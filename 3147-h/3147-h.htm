<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PREPARATION AND DEPARTURE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;One to make
ready, and two to prepare.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nine o&rsquo;clock one sunny
California morning, and Geoffrey Strong stood under the live-oak
trees in Las Flores Ca&ntilde;on, with a pot of black paint in
one hand and a huge brush in the other.&nbsp; He could have
handled these implements to better purpose and with better grace
had not his arms been firmly held by three laughing girls, who
pulled not wisely, but too well.&nbsp; He was further incommoded
by the presence of a small urchin who lay on the dusty ground
beneath his feet, fastening an upward clutch on the legs of his
trousers.</p>
<p>There were three large canvas tents directly in front of them,
yet no one of these seemed to be the object of dissension, but
rather a redwood board, some three feet in length, which was
nailed on a tree near by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Camp Frolic!&nbsp; Please let us name it Camp
Frolic!&rsquo; cried Bell Winship, with a persuasive twitch of
her cousin&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; not Camp Frolic,&rsquo; pleaded Polly
Oliver.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, pray let us have Camp Ha-Ha; my heart
is set upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you are Strong, be merciful,&rsquo; quoted Margery
Noble, coaxingly; &lsquo;take my advice and call it Harmony
Camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, a lovely woman, whose sweet face and smile
made you love her at once, came up the hill from the
brookside.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, what! still quarrelling,
children?&rsquo; she asked, laughingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me be
peacemaker.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just asked the Doctor for a name,
and he suggests Camp Chaparral.&nbsp; What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bell released one coat-tail.&nbsp; &lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t
wholly bad,&rsquo; she said, critically, while the other girls
clapped their hands with approval; for anything that Aunt Truth
suggested was sure to be quite right.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a minute, good people,&rsquo; cried Jack Howard,
flinging his fishing-tackle under a tree and sauntering toward
the scene of action.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose we have a referee, a
wise and noble judge.&nbsp; Call Hop Yet, and let him decide this
all-important subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His name being sung and shouted in various keys by the
assembled company, Hop Yet appeared at the door of the brush
kitchen, a broad grin on his countenance, a plucked fowl in his
hand.</p>
<p>Geoffrey took the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Hop Yet, you know I
got name, you got name, everybody got name.&nbsp; We want name
this camp: you sabe?&nbsp; Miss Bell, she say Camp Frolic.&nbsp;
Frolic all same heap good time&rsquo; (here he executed a sort of
war-dance which was intended to express wild joy).&nbsp;
&lsquo;Miss Pauline, she say Camp Ha-Ha, big laugh: sabe?&nbsp;
Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; (chorus joined in by all to fully
illustrate the subject).&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Madge, she say Camp
Harmony.&nbsp; Harmony all same heap quiet time, plenty eat,
plenty drink, plenty sleep, no fight, no too muchee talk.&nbsp;
Mrs. Winship, she say Camp Chaparral: you sabe?&nbsp; Chaparral,
Hop Yet.&nbsp; Now what you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hop Yet seemed to regard the question with mingled
embarrassment and amusement, but being a sharp and talkative
Chinaman gave his answer promptly: &lsquo;Me say Camp Chap-lal
heap good name; plenty chap-lal all lound; me hang um dish-cloth,
tow&rsquo;l, little boy&rsquo;s stockin&rsquo;, on chap-lal; all
same clo&rsquo;se-line velly good.&nbsp; Miss Bell she folic,
Miss Polly she ha! ha! allee same Camp Chap-lal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so Camp Chaparral it was; the redwood board flaunted the
assertion before the eyes of the public (which was a rather
limited one, to be sure) in less than half an hour, and the
artist, after painting the words in rustic letters a foot long,
cut branches of the stiff, ungracious bushes and nailed them to
the tree in confirmation and illustration of the fact.&nbsp; He
then carefully deposited the paint-pot in a secret place, where
it might be out of sight and touch of a certain searching eye and
mischievous hand well known and feared of him; but before the
setting sun had dropped below the line of purple mountain tops, a
small boy, who will be known in these annals as Dicky Winship,
might have been seen sitting on the empty paint-pot, while from a
dingy pool upon the ground he was attempting to paint a copy of
the aforesaid inscription upon the side of a too patient goat,
who saw no harm in the operation.&nbsp; He was alone, and very,
very happy.</p>

</a></p>
<p>And now I must tell you the way in which all this began.&nbsp;
You may not realise it, dear young folks, but this method of
telling a story is very much the fashion with grown-up people,
and of course I am not to blame, since I didn&rsquo;t begin
it.</p>
<p>The plan is this: You must first write a chapter showing all
your people, men, women, children, dogs, and cats, in a certain
place, doing certain things.&nbsp; Then you must go back a year
or two and explain how they all happen to be there.&nbsp; Perhaps
you may have to drag your readers twenty-five years into the
regions of the past, and show them the first tooth of your oldest
character; but that doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit,&mdash;the further
the better.&nbsp; Then, when everybody has forgotten what came to
pass in the first chapter, you are ready to take it up again, as
if there had never been any parenthesis.&nbsp; However, I shall
not introduce you to the cradles, cribs, or trundle-beds of my
merry young campers, but merely ask you to retrace your steps one
week, and look upon them in their homes.</p>
<p>On one of the pleasantest streets of a certain little
California town stood, and still stands for aught I know, a
pretty brown cottage, with its verandahs covered with
passion-vine and a brilliant rose-garden in front.&nbsp; It is
picturesque enough to attract the attention of any passer-by, and
if you had chosen to peep through the crevices in the thick vines
and look in at the open window, you might have thought it
lovelier within than without.</p>
<p>It was a bright day, and the gracious June sunshine flooded
the room with yellow light.&nbsp; Three young girls, perhaps
fourteen or fifteen years old, were seated in different parts of
the large room, plying industrious crochet needles and tatting
shuttles.&nbsp; Three pairs of bright eyes were dancing with fun
and gladness; and another pair, the softest and clearest of all,
looked out from a broad white bed in the corner,&mdash;tired
eyes, and oh, so patient, for the health-giving breezes wafted in
from the blue ocean and carried over mountain tops and
vine-covered slopes had so far failed to bring back Elsie
Howard&rsquo;s strength and vigour.</p>
<p>The graceful, brown-haired girl with the bright,
laughter-loving face, was Bell Winship.&nbsp; She of the dancing
blue eyes, pink cheeks, and reckless little sun-bonnet was
Pauline, otherwise Polly Oliver.&nbsp; Did you ever know a Polly
without some one of these things?&nbsp; Well, my Polly had them
all, and, besides, a saucy freckled nose, a crown of fluffy,
reddish-yellow hair, and a shower of coaxing little pitfalls
called dimples round her pretty mouth.&nbsp; She made you think
of a sunbeam, a morning songbird, a dancing butterfly, or an
impetuous little crocus just out after the first spring
shower.&nbsp; Dislike her?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Approve of her?&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t always.&nbsp; Love
her?&nbsp; Of course; you couldn&rsquo;t help yourself,&mdash;I
defy you.</p>
<p>To be sure, if you prefer a quiet life, and do not want to be
led into exploits of all kinds, invariably beginning with risk,
attended with danger, and culminating in despair, you had better
not engage in an intimate friendship with Miss Pauline Oliver,
but fix your affections on the quiet, thoughtful, but not less
lovable girl who sits by the bedside stroking Elsie
Howard&rsquo;s thin white hand.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I am obliged
to state that Margery Noble herself, earnest, demure, and given
to reflection, was Polly&rsquo;s willing slave and victim.&nbsp;
However, I&rsquo;ve forgotten to tell you that Polly was as open
and frank as the daylight, at once torrid and constant in her
affections, brave, self-forgetting as well as self-willed; and
that though she did have a tongue just the least bit saucy, she
used it valiantly in the defence of others.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll come out all right,&rsquo; said a dear
old-fashioned grandfather of hers whom she had left way back in a
Vermont farmhouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got to be purged
o&rsquo; considerable dross, but she&rsquo;ll come out pure gold,
I tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pretty, wise, tender Margery Noble, with her sleek brown
braids, her innocent, questioning eyes, her soft voice, willing
hands, and shy, quiet manners!&nbsp; &lsquo;She will either end
as the matron of an orphan asylum or as head-nurse in a
hospital.&rsquo;&nbsp; So Bell Winship often used to say; but
then she was chiefly celebrated for talking nonsense, and nobody
ever paid much attention to her.&nbsp; But if you should crave a
breath of fresh air, or want to believe that the spring has come,
just call Bell Winship in, as she walks with her breezy step down
the street.&nbsp; Her very hair seems instinct with life, with
its flying tendrils of bronze brightness and the riotous little
curls on her brow and temples.&nbsp; Then, too, she has a
particularly jaunty way of putting on her jacket, or wearing a
flower or a ribbon; and as for her ringing peal of laughter, it
is like a chime of silver bells.</p>
<p>Elsie Howard, the invalid friend of the girls, was as dear to
them as they were to each other.&nbsp; She kept the secrets of
the &lsquo;firm&rsquo;; mourned over their griefs and smiled over
their joys; was proud of their talents and tenderly blind to
their faults.&nbsp; The little wicker rocking-chair by the
bedside was often made a sort of confessional, at which she
presided, the tenderest and most sympathetic little priestess in
the universe; and every afternoon the piazza, with its lattice of
green vines, served as a mimic throne-room, where she was wont to
hold high court, surrounded by her devoted subjects.&nbsp; Here
Geoffrey Strong used often to read to the assembled company
<i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, or snatches
from the magazines, while Jack Howard lazily stretched himself
under the orange-trees and braided lariats, a favourite
occupation with California boys.&nbsp; About four o&rsquo;clock
Philip Noble would ride up from his father&rsquo;s fruit ranch,
some three miles out on the San Marcos road, and, hitching his
little sorrel mare Chispa at the gate, stay an hour before going
to the post-office.</p>
<p>This particular afternoon, however, was not one of
Elsie&rsquo;s bright ones, and there was no sign of court or
invalid queen on the piazza.&nbsp; The voices of the girls
floated out from Elsie&rsquo;s bedroom, while the boys, too,
seemed to be somewhere in the vicinity, for there was a constant
stirring about as of lively preparation, together with noise of
hammering and sawing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you were only going, Elsie, our cup of happiness
would be full,&rsquo; sighed Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not only would it be full, Bell, but it would be
running over, and we should positively stand in the slop,&rsquo;
said Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t frown at me, miss;
that expression is borrowed from no less a person than Sydney
Smith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think any more about me,&rsquo; smiled
Elsie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I can come down in the course of the
summer.&nbsp; I know it will be the happiest time in the world,
but I don&rsquo;t envy you a bit; in fact, I&rsquo;m very glad
you&rsquo;re going, because you&rsquo;ll have such a lovely
budget of adventures to tell me when you come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we come back, indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Bell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, we shall write long round-robin letters every few
days, and send them by the team.&nbsp; Papa says Pancho will have
to go over to the stage station at least once a week for letters
and any provisions we may need.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t that be delightful,&mdash;almost as
good as being there myself!&nbsp; And, Margery dear, you must
make them tell me every least little thing that happens.&nbsp;
You know they are such fly-aways that they&rsquo;ll only write me
when they learn to swim, or shoot a wildcat, or get lost in the
woods.&nbsp; I want to know all the stupid bits: what you have
for dinner, how and where you sleep, how your camp looks, what
you do from morning till night, and how Dicky behaves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can tell you that beforehand,&rsquo; said Bell,
dolefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jack will shoot him by mistake on
Thursday; he will be kicked by the horses Friday, and bitten by
tarantulas and rattlesnakes Saturday; he will eat poison oak on
Sunday, get lost in the ca&ntilde;on Monday, be eaten by a bear
Tuesday, and drowned in the pool Wednesday.&nbsp; These incidents
will complete his first week; and if they produce no effect on
his naturally strong constitution, he will treat us to another
week, containing just as many mishaps, but no
duplicates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the time this dismal prophecy was ended the other girls
were in a breathless fit of laughter, though all acknowledged it
was likely to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went over the camping-ground last summer,&rsquo; said
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know it is quite near papa&rsquo;s
sheep ranch, and it is certainly the most beautiful place in
California.&nbsp; The tents will be pitched at the mouth of the
ca&ntilde;on, where there is a view of the ocean, and just at the
back will be a lovely grove of wild oaks and
sycamore-trees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t it be delicious!&rsquo; sighed
Elsie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel as if I could sniff the air this
minute.&nbsp; But there!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t pretend that
I&rsquo;m dying for fresh air, with the breath of the sea coming
in at my south window, and a whiff of jasmine and honeysuckle
from the piazza.&nbsp; That would be nonsense.&nbsp; Are your
trunks packed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trunks!&rsquo; exclaimed Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would you
believe it, our clothes are packed in gunny-sacks!&nbsp; We start
in our camping-dresses, with ulsters for the steamer and dusters
for the long drive.&nbsp; Then we each have&mdash;let me see what
we have: a short, tough riding-skirt with a jersey, a
bathing-dress, and some gingham morning-gowns to wear about the
camp at breakfast-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And flannel gowns for the night, and two pairs of
boots, and a riding-cap and one hat apiece,&rsquo; added
Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But oh, Elsie, my dear, you should see Dicky in his
camping-suits,&rsquo; laughed Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are a
triumph of invention on mamma&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Just imagine!
one is of some enamelled cloth that was left over from the new
carriage cushions; it is very shiny and elegant; and the other,
truly, is of soft tanned leather, and just as pretty as it can
be.&nbsp; Then he has hob-nailed, copper-toed boots, and a hat
that ties under his chin.&nbsp; Poor little man, he has lost his
curls, too, and looks rather like a convict.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Howard came in the door while Bell was speaking, and
laughed heartily at the description of Dicky&rsquo;s curious
outfit.&nbsp; &lsquo;What time do you start?&rsquo; she asked, as
she laid a bunch of mignonette on Elsie&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At eleven to-morrow morning,&rsquo; Bell
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything is packed.&nbsp; We are to
start in the steamer, and when we come to our old landing, about
forty miles down the coast, we are to get off and take a
three-seated thorough-brace wagon, and drive over to Las Flores
Ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; Pancho has hired a funny little pack mule; he
says we shall need one in going up the mountain, and that the
boys can take him when they go out shooting,&mdash;to carry the
deer home, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I can bring Elsie down, as I hope, we must come by
land,&rsquo; said Mrs. Howard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought we could
take two days for the journey, sleeping at the Burtons&rsquo;
ranch on the way.&nbsp; The doctor says that if she can get
strength enough to bear the ride, the open-air life will do her
good, even if she does nothing but lie in the hammock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And be waited upon by six willing slaves,&rsquo; added
Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And be fed on canned corned beef and tomato
stew,&rsquo; laughed Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; said Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hop
Yet is a splendid cook, if he has anything to cook, and
we&rsquo;ll feed her on broiled titbits of baby venison,
goat&rsquo;s milk, wild bees&rsquo; honey, and cunning little
mourning doves, roasted on a spit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious,&rsquo; cried Bell, &lsquo;what
angels&rsquo; food! only I would as soon devour a pet canary as a
mourning dove.&nbsp; But to think that I&rsquo;ve been trying to
diet for a week in order to get intimate with suffering and
privation!&nbsp; Polly came to stay with me one night, and we
slept on the floor, with only a blanket under us, and no pillow;
it was perfectly horrid.&nbsp; Polly dreamed that her grandfather
ate up her grandmother, and I that Dicky stabbed the Jersey calf
with a pickle-fork.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Horrors!&rsquo; ejaculated Margery; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
a pleasant prospect for your future bedfellows.&nbsp; I hope the
gophers won&rsquo;t make you nervous, gnawing and scratching in
the straw; I got used to them last summer.&nbsp; But we really
must go, darling,&rsquo; and she stooped to kiss Elsie
good-bye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose you ought,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But remember you are to start from this gate; Aunt Truth
has promised me the fun of seeing you out of sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girls went out at a side door, and joined the boys, who
were busily at work cleaning their guns on the broad western
porch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you coming on?&rsquo; questioned Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, finely,&rsquo; answered Jack, who always
constituted himself chief spokesman, unless driven from the
rostrum by some one possessed of a nimbler tongue.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
only hope your feminine togs are in half as good
order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We take no baggage to speak of,&rsquo; said Bell,
loftily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa has cut us down to the very last
notch, and says the law allows very few pounds on this
trip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The less the better,&rsquo; quoth Geoff, cheerily;
&lsquo;then you&rsquo;ll have to polish up your mental
jewels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which you consider imitation, I suppose,&rsquo; sniffed
Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perish the thought!&rsquo; cried Jack.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But, speaking of mental jewels, you should see the
arrangements Geoff has made for polishing his.&nbsp; He has
actually stuck in six large volumes, any one of which would be a
remedy for sleeplessness.&nbsp; What are you going to study, Miss
Pol-y-on-o-mous Oliver?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Jack, let us decide at once whether you intend to
be respectful or not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t propose to expose
myself to your nonsense for two months unless you make me good
promises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that wasn&rsquo;t disrespectful.&nbsp; It is my
newest word, and it simply means having many titles.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure you have more than most people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll overlook the
irreverence this time, and announce that I shall not take
anything whatever to read, but simply reflect upon what I know
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may last for the first week,&rsquo; said Bell,
slyly, &lsquo;but what will you do afterward?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll reflect upon what you don&rsquo;t
know,&rsquo; retorted Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;That will easily occupy
me two months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, at the very moment this stinging remark was made,
Phil Noble dashed up to the front gate, flung his bridle over the
hitching-post, and lifted his hat from a very warm brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hail, chief of the commissary department!&rsquo; cried
Geoffrey, with mock salute.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you despatched the
team?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; everything is all right,&rsquo; said Phil,
breathlessly, delivering himself of his information in spasmodic
bursts of words.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such a lot of work it was!
here&rsquo;s the list.&nbsp; Pancho will dump them on the ground
and let us settle them when we get there.&nbsp; Such a
load!&nbsp; You should have seen it!&nbsp; Hardly room for him to
sit up in front with the Chinaman.&nbsp; Just hear this,&rsquo;
and he drew a large document from what Polly called &lsquo;a
back-stairs pocket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty cans corned beef, four guns, three Dutch cheeses,
pickles, fishing-tackle, flour, bacon, three bushels onions,
crate of dishes, Jack&rsquo;s banjo, potatoes, Short History of
the English People, cooking utensils, three hair pillows, box of
ginger-snaps, four hammocks, coffee, cartridges, sugar,
Macaulay&rsquo;s Essays, Pond&rsquo;s extract, sixteen hams,
Bell&rsquo;s guitar, pop-corn, molasses, salt, St. Jacob&rsquo;s
Oil, Conquest of Mexico, sack of almonds, flea-powder, and smoked
herring.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I packed them all myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In precisely that order?&rsquo; questioned Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In precisely that order, Miss Oliver,&rsquo; returned
Phil, urbanely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any one who feels that said packing
might be improved upon has only to mount the fleet Arabian
yonder&rsquo; (the animal alluded to seized this moment to stand
on three legs, hang his head, and look dejected), &lsquo;and,
giving him the rein, speed o&rsquo;er the trackless plain which
leads to San Miguel, o&rsquo;ertake the team, and re-pack the
contents according to her own satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No butter, nor eggs, nor fresh vegetables?&rsquo; asked
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall starve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; quoth Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;Polly will
gracefully dispose a horse-blanket about her shoulders, to shield
her from the chill dews of the early morn, mount the pack mule
exactly at cock-crow everyday, and ride to a neighbouring ranch
where there are tons of the aforesaid articles awaiting our
consumption.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you see me doing it, girls?&nbsp; Does it seem
entirely natural?&rsquo; asked Polly, with great gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now hear my report as chairman of the committee of
arrangements,&rsquo; said Geoffrey Strong, seating himself with
dignity on a barrel of nails.&nbsp; &lsquo;The tents, ropes,
tool-boxes, bed-sacks, blankets, furniture, etc., all went down
on Monday&rsquo;s steamer, and I have a telegram from
Larry&rsquo;s Landing saying that they arrived in good order, and
that a Mexican gentleman who owns a mammoth wood-cart will take
them up to-morrow when we go ourselves.&nbsp; The procession will
move at one <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, wind and weather
permitting, in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; Chief Noble on his gallant broncho.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; Commander Strong on his ditto, ditto.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; Main conveyance or triumphal chariot, driven
by Aide-de-Camp John Howard, and carrying Dr. and Mrs. Winship,
our most worshipful and benignant host and hostess; Master Dick
Winship, the heir-apparent; three other young persons not worth
mentioning; and four cans of best leaf lard, which I omitted to
put with the other provisions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; Wood-cart containing baggage, driven by
Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Felipe Hilario Noriega from Dead Wood
Gulch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5.&nbsp; One small tan terrier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Geoff, Geoff, pray do stop! it&rsquo;s too
much!&rsquo; cried the girls in a fit of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; shouted Jack, tossing his hat into a
tall eucalyptus-tree in his excitement, &lsquo;Tent life for
ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, ye pomps and vanities!&rsquo; chanted Bell,
kissing her hand in imaginary farewell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Verily the
noisy city shall know us no more, for we depart for the green
forests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the city will not be as noisy <i>when</i> you
depart,&rsquo; murmured Jack, with an impudence that luckily
passed unnoticed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Elsie could only come too!&rsquo; sighed Polly.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Wednesday morning dawned as bright and beautiful as all
mornings are wont to dawn in Southern California.&nbsp; A light
mist hung over the old adobe mission church, through which, with
its snow-white towers and cold, clear-cut lines, it rose like a
frozen fairy castle.&nbsp; Bell opened her sleepy eyes with the
very earliest birds, and running to the little oval window,
framed with white-rose vines, looked out at the new day just
creeping up into the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear and beautiful home of mine, how charming, how
charming you are!&nbsp; I wonder if you are not really
Paradise!&rsquo; she said, dreamily; and the marvel is that the
rising sun did not stop a moment in sheer surprise at the sight
of this radiant morning vision; for the oval window opening to
the east was a pretty frame, with its outline marked by the dewy
rose-vine covered with hundreds of pure, half-opened buds and
swaying tendrils, and she stood there in it, a fair image of the
morning in her innocent white gown.&nbsp; Her luminous eyes still
mirrored the shadowy visions of dreamland, mingled with dancing
lights of hope and joyful anticipation; while on her fresh
cheeks, which had not yet lost the roundness of childhood, there
glowed, as in the eastern skies, the faint pink blush of the
morning.</p>
<p>The town is yet asleep, and in truth it is never apt to be
fairly wide awake.&nbsp; The air is soft and balmy; the lovely
Pacific, a quivering, sparkling sheet of blue and grey and green
flecked with white foam, stretches far out until it is lost in
the rosy sky; and the mountains, all purple and pink and faint
crimson and grey, stand like sentinels along the shore.&nbsp; The
scent of the roses, violets, and mignonette mingled with the
cloying fragrance of the datura is heavy in the still air.&nbsp;
The bending, willowy pepper-trees show myriad bunches of yellow
blossoms, crimson seed-berries, and fresh green leaves, whose
surface, not rain-washed for months, is as full of colour as
ever.&nbsp; The palm-trees rise without a branch, tall, slender,
and graceful, from the warmly generous earth, and spread at last,
as if tired of their straightness, into beautiful crowns of fans,
which sway toward each other with every breath of air.&nbsp;
Innumerable butterflies and humming-birds, in the hot, dazzling
sunshine of noonday, will be hovering over the beds of sweet
purple heliotrope and finding their way into the hearts of the
passion-flowers, but as yet not the faintest whirr of wings can
be heard.&nbsp; Looking eastward or westward, you see either
brown foot-hills, or, a little later on, emerald slopes whose
vines hang heavy with the half-ripened grapes.</p>
<p>And hark!&nbsp; A silvery note strikes on the dewy
stillness.&nbsp; It is the mission bell ringing for morning mass;
and if you look yonder you may see the Franciscan friars going to
prayers, with their loose grey gowns, their girdle of rope, their
sandaled feet, and their jingling rosaries; and perhaps a Spanish
se&ntilde;orita, with her trailing dress, and black shawl loosely
thrown over her head, from out the folds of which her two dark
eyes burn like gleaming fires.&nbsp; A solitary Mexican gallops
by, with gayly decorated saddle and heavily laden saddle-bags
hanging from it; perhaps he is taking home provisions to his wife
and dark-eyed babies who live up in a little dimple of the
mountain side, almost hidden from sight by the olive-trees.&nbsp;
And then a patient, hardy little mustang lopes along the street,
bearing on his back three laughing boys, one behind the other, on
a morning ride into town from the <i>mesa</i>.</p>
<p>The mist had floated away from the old mission now, the sun
has climbed a little higher, and Bell has come away from the
window in a gentle mood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Polly, I don&rsquo;t see how anybody can be wicked
in such a beautiful, beautiful world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Polly, dipping her curly head deep
into the water-bowl, and coming up looking like a little drowned
kitten.&nbsp; &lsquo;When you want to be hateful, you don&rsquo;t
stop to think whether you&rsquo;re looking at a cactus or a
rosebush, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; sighed Bell, quite silenced by this
practical illustration.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll try the
effect of the landscape on my temper by dressing Dicky, while he
dances about the room and plays with his tan terrier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it happened that Dicky was on his very best behaviour, and
stood as still as a signpost while being dressed.&nbsp; It is
true he ate a couple of matches and tumbled down-stairs twice
before breakfast, so that after that hurried meal Bell tied him
to one of the verandah posts, that he might not commit any act
vicious enough to keep them at home.&nbsp; As he had a huge
pocket full of apricots he was in perfect good-humour, not taking
his confinement at all to heart, inasmuch as it commanded a full
view of the scene of action.&nbsp; His amiability was further
increased, moreover, by the possession of a bright new
policeman&rsquo;s whistle, which was carefully tied to his
button-hole by a neat little silk cord, and which his fond
parents intended that he should blow if he chanced to fall into
danger during his rambles about the camp.&nbsp; We might as well
state here, however, that this precaution proved fruitless, for
he blew it at all times and seasons; and everybody became so
hardened to its melodious shriek that they paid no attention to
it whatever,&mdash;history, or fable, thus again repeating
itself.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Noble had driven Margery and Phil into town from
the fruit ranch, and were waiting to see the party off.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oliver was to live in the Winship house during the
absence of the family, and was aiding them to do those numberless
little things that are always found undone at the last
moment.&nbsp; She had given her impetuous daughter a dozen fond
embraces, smothering in each a gentle warning, and stood now with
Mrs. Winship at the gate, watching the three girls, who had gone
on to bid Elsie good-bye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Pauline won&rsquo;t give you any trouble,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is so apt to be too impulsive and
thoughtless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall enjoy her,&rsquo; said sweet Aunt Truth, with
that bright, cordial smile of hers that was like a
blessing.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has a very loving heart, and is easily
led.&nbsp; How pretty the girls look, and how different they
are!&nbsp; Polly is like a thistledown or a firefly, Margery like
one of our home Mayflowers, and I can&rsquo;t help thinking my
Bell like a sunbeam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girls did look very pretty; for their mothers had
fashioned their camping-dresses with much care and taste, taking
great pains to make them picturesque and appropriate to their
summer life &lsquo;under the greenwood tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Over a plain full skirt of heavy crimson serge Bell wore a
hunting jacket and drapery of dark leaf-green, like a bit of
forest against a sunset.&nbsp; Her hair, which fell in a waving
mass of burnished brightness to her waist, was caught by a silver
arrow, and crowned by a wide soft hat of crimson felt encircled
with a bird&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Margery wore a soft grey flannel, the colour of a dove&rsquo;s
throat, adorned with rows upon rows of silver braid and sparkling
silver buttons; while her big grey hat had nothing but a silver
cord and tassel tied round it in Spanish fashion.</p>
<p>Polly was all in sailor blue, with a distractingly natty
little double-breasted coat and great white rolling collar.&nbsp;
Her hat swung in her hand, as usual, showing her boyish head of
sunny auburn curls, and she carried on a neat chatelaine a silver
cup and little clasp-knife, as was the custom in the party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult,&rsquo; Polly often
exclaimed, &lsquo;to get a dress that will tone down your hair
and a hat that will tone up your nose, when the first is red and
the last a snub!&nbsp; My nose is the root of all evil; it makes
people think I&rsquo;m saucy before I say a word; and as for my
hair, they think I must be peppery, no matter if I were really as
meek as Moses.&nbsp; Now there&rsquo;s Margery, the dear, darling
mouse!&nbsp; People look at her two sleek braids, every hair
doing just what it ought to do and lying straight and smooth, and
ask, &ldquo;Who is that sweet girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
something wrong somewhere.&nbsp; I ought not to suffer because of
one small, simple, turned-up nose and a head of hair which
reveals the glowing tints of autumn, as Jack gracefully
says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they come!&rsquo; shouted Jack from the group on
the Howards&rsquo; piazza.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christopher Columbus,
what gorgeousness!&nbsp; The Flamingo, the Dove, and the
Blue-jay!&nbsp; Good-morning, young ladies; may we be allowed to
travel in the same steamer with your highnesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t be troubled,&rsquo; laughed
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall not disclose these glories until we
reach the camp.&nbsp; But you are dressed as usual.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the fact is,&rsquo; answered Geoffrey, &lsquo;our
courage failed us at the last moment.&nbsp; We donned our
uniforms, and looked like brigands, highway robbers, cowboys,
firemen,&mdash;anything but modest young men; and as it was too
warm for ulsters, we took refuge in civilised raiment for
to-day.&nbsp; When we arrive, you shall behold our dashing
sombreros fixed up with peacock feathers, and our refulgent
shirts, which are of the most original style and
decoration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aboriginal, in fact,&rsquo; said Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
have broad belts of alligator skin, pouches, pistols,
bowie-knives, and tan-coloured shoes; but we dislike to flaunt
them before the eyes of a city public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they are!&rsquo; cried Geoffrey, from the
gate.&nbsp; &lsquo;Uncle, and aunt, and Dicky, and&mdash;good
gracious!&nbsp; Is he really going to take that wretched tan
terrier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t go without him,&rsquo; said Bell,
briefly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are cases where it is better to
submit than to fight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the last good-byes were said, and Elsie bore up bravely;
better, indeed, than the others, who shed many a furtive tear at
leaving her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Make haste and get well,
darling,&rsquo; whispered the girls, lovingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, pray, dear Mrs. Howard, bring her down to us as
soon as possible.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll take such good care of
her,&rsquo; teased Bell, with one last squeeze, and strong signs
of a shower in both eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, girls and boys,&rsquo; said kind Dr. Paul,
&lsquo;the steamer has blown her first whistle, and we must be
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, how clear and beautiful a day it was, and how charmingly
gracious Dame Ocean looked in her white caps and blue
ruffles!&nbsp; Even the combination steamboat smell of dinner,
oil, and close air was obliterated by the keen sea-breeze.</p>
<p>The good ship Orizaba ploughed her way through the sparkling,
sun-lit waves, traversing quickly the distance which lay between
the young people and their destination.&nbsp; They watched the
long white furrow that stretched in her wake, the cloud of black
smoke which floated like a dark shadow above the laughing crests
of the waves, and the flocks of sea-gulls sailing overhead, with
wild shrill screams ever and anon swooping down for some bit of
food flung from the ship, and then floating for miles on the
waves.</p>
<p>How they sung &lsquo;Life on the Ocean Wave,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bounding Billow,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rocked in the Cradle of
the Deep!&rsquo;&nbsp; How Jack chanted,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I wish I were a fish,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a great long tail;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tiny little tittlebat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wiggle or a whale,<br />
In the middle of the great blue sea.&nbsp; Oh, my!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, how I long to be there!&rsquo; exclaimed Philip,
&lsquo;to throw aside all the formal customs of a wicked world I
abhor, and live a free life under the blue sky!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Philip Noble!&nbsp; I never saw you inside of a
house in my life,&rsquo; cried Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes; you&rsquo;re mistaken.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
obliged to eat most of my meals in the house, and sleep there;
but I don&rsquo;t approve of it, and it&rsquo;s a trial to be
borne with meekness only when there&rsquo;s no remedy for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; said Jack, &lsquo;even when we are
out-of-doors we are shelling the reluctant almond, poisoning the
voracious gopher, pruning grape-vines, and
&ldquo;sich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I am only going to shoot to eat,
and eat to shoot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hope you&rsquo;ve improved since last year, or
you&rsquo;ll have a low diet,&rsquo; murmured Phil, in an
undertone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man of genius must expect to be the butt of
ridicule,&rsquo; sighed Jack, meekly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll not repine, although your heartstrings
break, will you?&rsquo; said Polly, sympathisingly;
&lsquo;especially in the presence of several witnesses who have
seen you handle a gun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How glad I am that I&rsquo;m too near-sighted to
shoot,&rsquo; said Geoffrey, taking off the eye-glasses that made
him look so wise and dignified.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall lounge under
the trees, read Macaulay, and order the meals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall need an assistant about the camp,&rsquo; said
Aunt Truth, smilingly; &lsquo;but I hardly think he&rsquo;ll have
much time to lounge; when everything else fails, there&rsquo;s
always Dicky, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Geoffrey looked discouraged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, furthermore, I declare by the nose of the great
Tam o&rsquo; Shanter that I will cut down every tree in the
vicinity ere you shall lounge under it,&rsquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Softly, my boy.&nbsp; Hill&rsquo;s blue-gum forest is
not so very far away.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have your hands
full,&rsquo; laughed Dr. Paul.</p>
<p>Here Margery and Bell joined the group after a quick walk up
and down the deck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; said Bell, excitedly, &lsquo;we certainly
are nearing the place.&nbsp; Do you see that bend in the shore,
and don&rsquo;t you remember that the landing isn&rsquo;t far
below?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bell&rsquo;s bump of locality is immense.&nbsp; There
are nineteen bends in the shore exactly like that one before we
reach the landing.&nbsp; How many knots an hour do you suppose
this ship travels, my fair cousin?&rsquo; asked Geoffrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could tell better,&rsquo; replied Bell calmly,
&lsquo;if I could ever remember how many knots made a mile, or
how many miles made a knot; but I always forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, see!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a porpoise!&rsquo; cried
Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;Polly, why is a porpoise like a
water-lily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But before he could say &lsquo;Guess,&rsquo; Phil, Geoff, and
the girls had drawn themselves into a line, and, with a whispered
&lsquo;One, two, three,&rsquo; to secure a good start, replied in
concert, &lsquo;We-give-it-up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a deafening shout!&rsquo; cried Aunt Truth, coming
out of the cabin.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,
pray?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, aunty,&rsquo; laughed Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
we have formed a society for suppressing Jack&rsquo;s conundrums,
and this is our first public meeting.&nbsp; How do you like the
watchword?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Truth smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was very audible,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yours is evidently not a secret
society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could find out who originated this
plan,&rsquo; quoth Jack, murderously.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I suppose
it&rsquo;s one of you girls, and I can&rsquo;t revenge
myself.&nbsp; Oh, when will this barrier between the sexes be
removed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust not in your lifetime,&rsquo; shuddered Polly,
&lsquo;or we might as well begin to &ldquo;stand round our dying
beds&rdquo; at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> the distance was in
reality, the steamer had consumed more time than usual, and it
was quite two o&rsquo;clock, instead of half-past twelve, as they
had expected, before they were landed on the old and almost
forgotten pier, and saw the smoke of the Orizaba as she steamed
away.</p>
<p>After counting over their bags and packages to see if anything
had been forgotten, they looked about them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There was a dirty little settlement, a mile or two to the
south, consisting of a collection of tumble-down adobe houses
which looked like a blotch on the brown hillside; a few cattle
were browsing near by, and the locality seemed to be well
supplied with lizards, which darted over the dusty ground in all
directions.&nbsp; But the startling point of the landscape was
that it showed no sign of human life, and Pancho&rsquo;s orders
had been to have Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Felipe Hilario Noriega
and his wood-cart on hand promptly at half-past twelve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can Pancho have forgotten?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can he have lost his way and never arrived here at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Felipe Hilario Noriega have
grown tired of waiting and gone off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Felipe Hilario Noriega been
drinking too much aguardiente and so forgotten to
come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Pancho been murdered by highway robbers, and served
up into stew for their evening meal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Hop Yet for dessert!&nbsp; Oh,
horrible!&rsquo;&nbsp; These were some of the questions and
exclamations that greeted the ears of the lizards, and caused
them to fly over the ground in a more excited fashion than
ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One thing is certain.&nbsp; If Pancho has been stupid
enough to lose his way coming fifty miles down the coast,
I&rsquo;ll discharge him,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship, with
decision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you find him,&rsquo; added Aunt Truth,
prudently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; But really, mamma, this looks
discouraging; I am afraid we can&rsquo;t get into camp this
evening.&nbsp; Shall we go up to the nearest ranch house for the
night, and see what can be done to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; exclaimed the young people, with one
deafening shout.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; echoed Philip separately.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have vowed that a bed shall not know me for three months, and
I&rsquo;ll keep my vow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say to this, Uncle Doc?&rsquo; said
Geoffrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose you go up to the storehouse and
office,&mdash;it&rsquo;s about a mile,&mdash;and see if the goods
are there all right, and whether the men saw Pancho on his way up
to the ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Phil and I will ride over
here somewhere to get a team, or look up Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel
Felipe Hilario Noriega.&nbsp; Jack can stay with Aunt Truth and
the girls, to watch developments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, papa, can&rsquo;t we pitch the camp to-night,
somehow?&rsquo; asked Bell, piteously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&nbsp; We are behindhand already;
and if we get started within an hour we can&rsquo;t reach the
ground I selected before dark and we can&rsquo;t choose any
nearer one, because if Pancho is anywhere in creation he is on
the identical spot I sent him to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Dr. Paul, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we could
do,&rsquo; suggested Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we get any kind of a
start, we can&rsquo;t fail to reach camp by seven or eight
o&rsquo;clock at latest.&nbsp; Now it&rsquo;s bright moonlight,
and if we find Pancho, he&rsquo;ll have the baggage unloaded, and
Hop Yet will have a fire lighted.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to prevent
our swinging the hammocks for the ladies?&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll
just roll up in our blankets by the fire, for to-night.&nbsp;
Then we&rsquo;ll get to housekeeping in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This plan received a most enthusiastic reception.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you are all agreed, I suppose we may as well begin roughing it
now as at any time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You may have noticed sometimes, after having fortified
yourself against a terrible misfortune which seemed in store for
you, that it didn&rsquo;t come, after all.&nbsp; Well, it was so
in this case; for just as Dr. Winship and the boys started out
over the hillside at a brisk pace, an immense cloud of dust, some
distance up the road, attracted their attention, and they came to
a sudden standstill.</p>
<p>The girls held their breath in anxious expectation, and at
length gave an irrepressible shout of joy and relief when there
issued from the dense grey cloud the familiar four-horse team,
with Daisy, Tule Molly, Villikins, and Dinah, looking as fresh as
if they had not been driven a mile, tough little mustangs that
they were.</p>
<p>A long conversation in Spanish ensued, which, being translated
by Dr. Winship, furnished all necessary information concerning
the delay.</p>
<p>S. D. M. F. H. N. stated that Pancho was neither faithless nor
stupid, but was waiting for them on the camping-ground, and that
as the goods were already packed in his wood-cart he would follow
them immediately.&nbsp; So the whole party started without more
delay; Dr. and Mrs. Winship, Master Paul, Jack Howard, and the
three girls riding in the wagon, while Geoffrey and Philip
galloped ahead on horseback.</p>
<p>It was a long, dusty, tiresome ride; and Dicky, who had been
as good all day as any saint ever carved in marble and set in a
niche, grew rather warm, cross, and hungry, although he had been
consuming ginger-snaps and apricots since early morning.&nbsp;
After asking plaintively for the fiftieth time how long it would
be before dinner, he finally succumbed to his weariness, and
dropping his yellow head, that was like a cowslip ball, in his
mother&rsquo;s lap, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>But the young people, whose eyes were not blinded by hunger
and sleep, found more than enough to interest them on this dusty
California road, winding as it did through grand old growths of
trees, acres and acres of waving grain, and endless stretches of
gorgeous yellow mustard, the stalks of which were five or six
feet high, almost hiding from view the boys who dashed into the
golden forest from time to time.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill they passed an old adobe hut, with a
crowd of pretty, swarthy, frowzy Mexican children playing in the
sunshine, while their mother, black-haired and ample of figure,
occupied herself in hanging great quantities of jerked beef on a
sort of clothes-line running between the eucalyptus-trees.</p>
<p>The father, a wild-looking individual in a red shirt and
enormous hat, came from behind the hut, unhitched the stout
little broncho tied to the fence, gave the poor animal a
desperately tight &lsquo;cinch,&rsquo; threw himself into the
saddle without touching his foot to the lumbering wooden
stirrups, and, digging his spurs well into the horse&rsquo;s
sides, was out of sight in an instant, leaving only a huge cloud
of dust to cover his disappearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How those fellows do ride!&rsquo; exclaimed Dr.
Winship, savagely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish they were all obliged to
walk until they knew how to treat a horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then they&rsquo;d walk straight into the
millennium,&rsquo; said Jack, sagely, &lsquo;for their cruelty
seems to be an instinct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how beautifully they ride, too!&rsquo; said
Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mamma and I were sitting on the hotel piazza
the other day, watching two young Spaniards who were performing
feats of horsemanship.&nbsp; They dropped four-bit pieces on the
dusty road, and riding up to them at full speed clutched them
from the ground in some mysterious way that was perfectly
wonderful.&nbsp; Then Nick Gutierrez mounted a bucking horse, and
actually rolled and lighted a cigarette while the animal bucked
with all his might.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;See that cunning, cunning <i>muchachita</i>,
mamma!&rsquo; cried Bell; for, as they stopped at the top of the
hill to let the horses breathe, one of the little Mexican
children ran after them, holding out a handful of glowing yellow
poppies.</p>
<p>She was distractingly pretty, with a beauty that is
short-lived with the people of her race.&nbsp; The afternoon sun
shone down fiercely on her waving coal-black locks, and brought a
rich colour to her nut-brown cheek; she had one little flimsy,
ragged garment, neither long, broad, nor thick, which hung about
her picturesquely; and, with her soft, dark, sleepy eyes, the
rows of little white teeth behind her laughing red mouth, and the
vivid yellow blossoms in her tiny outstretched hand, she was a
very charming vision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Como te llamas</i>, <i>muchachita</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp;
(What is your name, little one?) asked Bell, airing her Spanish,
which was rather good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Teresita,&rsquo; she answered, with a pretty accent, as
she scratched a set of five grimy little toes to and fro in the
dusty ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Throw her a bit, papa,&rsquo; whispered Bell; and, as
he did so, Teresita caught the piece of silver very deftly, and
ran excitedly back to the centre of the chattering group in front
of the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How intense everything is in California!&nbsp; Do you
know what I mean, mamma?&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fruit
is so immense, the ca&ntilde;ons so deep, the trees so big, the
hills so high, the rain so wet, and the drought so
dry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fleas so many, the fleas so spry,&rsquo; chanted
Jack, who had perceived that Bell was talking in rhyme without
knowing it.&nbsp; &lsquo;California is just the place for you,
Bell; it gives you a chance for innumerable adjectives heaped one
on the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t always heap up adjectives,&rsquo; replied
Bell, with dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I wish to describe you, for
instance, I simply say &ldquo;that hateful boy,&rdquo; and let it
go at that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack retired to private life for a season.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to paint a picture of Teresita,&rsquo;
said Margery, who had a pretty talent for sketching, &lsquo;and
call it The Summer Child, or some such thing.&nbsp; I should
think the famous old colour artists might have loved to paint
this gorgeous flame-tinted poppy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not poppy,&mdash;eschscholtzia,&rsquo; corrected Jack,
coming rapidly to the surface again, after Bell&rsquo;s rebuke,
and delivering himself of the tongue-confusing word with a
terrible grimace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not writing a botany,&rsquo; retorted
Margery; &lsquo;and I can never remember that word, much less
spell it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how it grows under such an
abominable Russian name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse than
ichthyosaurus.&nbsp; Do you remember that funny nonsense
verse?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I is for ichthyosaurus,<br />
Who lived when the world was all porous;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But he fainted with shame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he first heard his name,<br />
And departed a long while before us.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The Spaniards are more poetic,&rsquo; said Aunt Truth,
&lsquo;for they call it <i>la copa de oro</i>, the golden
cup.&nbsp; Oh, see them yonder!&nbsp; It is like the Field of the
Cloth of Gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sight would have driven a royal florist mad with joy: a
hillside that was a swaying mass of radiant bloom, a joyous
carnival of vivid colour, in which the thousand golden goblets,
turned upward to the sun, were dancing, and glowing, and shaming
out of countenance the purple and blue and pink masses which
surrounded them on every side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know Professor Pinnie told us that every
well-informed young girl should know at least the flora of her
own State,&rsquo; said Jack, after the excitement had
subsided.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, one thing is certain: Professor Pinnie never knew
the <i>state</i> of his own <i>flora</i>, or at least he kept his
wife sorting and arranging his specimens all the time; and I
think he&rsquo;s a regular old frump,&rsquo; said Polly,
irreverently, but meeting Aunt Truth&rsquo;s reproving glance,
which brought a blush and a whispered &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo;
she went on, &lsquo;Well, what I mean is, he doesn&rsquo;t know
any more than other people, after all; for he cares for nothing
but bushes and herbs and seeds and shrubs and roots and stamens
and pistils; and he can&rsquo;t tell whether a flower is lovely
or not, he is so crazy to find out where it belongs and tie a tag
round it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must agree with Polly,&rsquo; laughed Jack.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, I went to ride with him one day in the Cathedral
Oaks, and he made me get off my horse every five minutes to dig
up roots and tie them to the pommel of his old saddle, so that we
came into town looking like moving herbariums.&nbsp; The
stable-man lifted him on to his horse when he started, I suppose,
and he would have been there yet if he hadn&rsquo;t been helped
off.&nbsp; Bah!&rsquo;&nbsp; For Jack had a supreme contempt for
any man who was less than a centaur.</p>
<p>By this time they had turned off the main thoroughfare, and
were travelling over a bit of old stage road which was anything
but easy riding.&nbsp; There they met some men who were driving
an enormous band of sheep to a distant ranch for pasture, which
gave saucy Polly the chance to ask Dr. Winship, innocently, why
white sheep ate so much more than black ones.</p>
<p>He fell into the trap at once, and answered unsuspectingly, in
a surprised tone, &lsquo;Why, do they?&rsquo; giving her the
longed-for opportunity to respond, &lsquo;Yes, of course, because
there are so many more of &rsquo;em; don&rsquo;t you
see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are behind the times, Dr. Paul,&rsquo; said
Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an ancient joke.&nbsp; Just look
at those sheep, sir.&nbsp; How many are there?&nbsp; Eight
hundred, say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even more, I should think,&mdash;a thousand, certainly;
and rather thin they look, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should imagine they might,&rsquo; said Bell,
sympathetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I first came to California I
never could see how the poor creatures found anything to eat on
these bare, brown hillsides, until the farmers showed me the
prickly little burr clover balls that cover the ground.&nbsp; But
see, mamma! there are some tiny lambs, poor, tired, weak-legged
little things; I wonder if they will live through the
journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which reminds me,&rsquo; said Jack, giving Villikins a
touch of the whip, &lsquo;that nothing is so calculated to
disturb your faith in and love for lambs as life on a sheep
ranch.&nbsp; Innocent!&nbsp; Good gracious!&nbsp; I never saw
such&mdash;such&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gasping, staggering, stuttering, stammering
tom-fools,&rsquo; interposed Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what
Carlyle called <i>one</i> Lamb,&mdash;dear Mr. &ldquo;Roast
Pig&rdquo; Charles; and a mean old thing he was, too, for doing
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is just strong enough to apply to the actual
lamb; not the lamb of romance, but the lamb of reality.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t get him anywhere; he doesn&rsquo;t know enough.&nbsp;
He won&rsquo;t drive, he can&rsquo;t follow; he&rsquo;s too
stupid.&nbsp; Why, I went out for a couple of &rsquo;em once,
that were lost in the ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; I found
them,&mdash;that was comparatively easy; but when I tried to get
them home, I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; At last, after infinite
trouble, I managed to drive them up on to the trail, which was so
narrow there was but one thing for a rational creature to do, and
that was to go ahead.&nbsp; Then, if you&rsquo;ll believe me,
those idiots kept bleating and getting under the horse&rsquo;s
fore-feet; finally, one of them, the champion simpleton, tumbled
over into the ca&ntilde;on, and I tied the legs of the other one
together, and carried him home on the front of my
saddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are innocent, any way,&rsquo; insisted
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re
not.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear these people who interfere with all
your cherished ideas, and say that Columbus didn&rsquo;t discover
America, and Shakespeare wasn&rsquo;t Shakespeare, and William
Tell didn&rsquo;t shoot the apple.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, I claim that the lamb is not half so much
an emblem of innocence as he is of utter and profound
stupidity.&nbsp; There is that charming old lyric about
Mary&rsquo;s little lamb; I can explain that.&nbsp; After he came
to school (which was an error of judgment at the very beginning),
he made the rumpus, you know&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And then the teacher turned him out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still he lingered nee-ar,<br />
And waited patiently about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Mary did appee-ar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course he did.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know enough to go home
alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And then he ran to her and laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His head upon her arr-um,<br />
As if to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll keep me from all
harr-um.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if a lamb could be capable of that amount of
reasoning!&nbsp; And then</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What makes the lamb love Mary so?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eager children cry;<br />
&lsquo;Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher did reply.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And might have added that as Mary fed the lamb three times a
day and twice on Sundays, he probably not only knew on which side
his daily bread was buttered, but also who buttered
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dreadful boy!&rsquo; laughed Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Polly,
pray lower the umbrella; we are going to meet some respectable
people, and we actually are too dirty to be seen.&nbsp; I have
really been eating dust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must be equally dusty,&rsquo; said Polly,
sagely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, it is the Burtons, from Tacitas
ranch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Burton ranch wagon was drawn up, as its driver recognised
Dr. Winship, and he proceeded to cheer the spirits of the party
by telling them that he had passed Pancho two hours before, and
that he was busily clearing rubbish from the
camping-ground.&nbsp; This was six o&rsquo;clock, and by a little
after eight the weary, happy party were seated on saddle-blankets
and carriage-cushions round a cheery camp-fire, eating a frugal
meal, which tasted sweeter than nectar and ambrosia to their keen
appetites.</p>
<p>The boys expressed their intention of spending the night in
unpacking their baggage and getting to rights generally, but Dr.
Winship placed a prompt and decisive veto on this proposition,
and they submitted cheerfully to his better judgment.</p>
<p>Getting to bed was an exciting occupation for everybody.&nbsp;
Dicky was first tucked up in a warm nest of rugs and blankets,
under a tree, and sank into a profound slumber at once, with the
happy unconsciousness of childhood.&nbsp; His father completed
the preparations for his comfort by opening a huge umbrella and
arranging it firmly over his head, so that no falling leaf might
frighten him and no sudden gust of air blow upon his face.</p>
<p>Bell stood before her hammock, and meditated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;going to bed is a simple
matter after all, when you have shorn it of all useless
formalities.&nbsp; Let me see: I generally walk to and fro in the
room, eating a bunch of grapes or an orange, look out of the
window five or ten minutes, brush my hair, read my chapter in the
Bible, take my book and study Spanish five minutes, on the
principle of that abnormal woman who learned ninety-six languages
while she was waiting for the kettle to boil in the
morning&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must have been a slow boiler,&rsquo; interrupted Polly,
wickedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seems to me it would have been economy to
sell it and buy a new one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Polly! you are so wilfully stupid!&nbsp; The kettle
isn&rsquo;t the point&mdash;but the languages.&nbsp; Besides, she
didn&rsquo;t learn all the ninety-six while the kettle was
boiling once, you know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; That alters the case.&nbsp;
Thank you,&rsquo; said Polly, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now observe me,&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
made the getting into a hammock a study.&nbsp; I first open it
very wide at the top with both hands; then, holding it in that
position, I gracefully revolve my body from left to right as upon
an imaginary swivel; meantime I raise my right foot considerably
from mother earth, with a view to passing it over the
hammock&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; Every move is calculated, you
perceive, and produces its own share of the perfect result; the
method is the same that Rachel used in rehearsing her wonderful
tragic poses.&nbsp; I am now seated in the hammock, you observe,
with both hands extending the net from side to side and the right
foot well in position; I now raise the left foot with a swift but
admirably steady movement, and I am&mdash;Help!&nbsp;
Help!!&nbsp; Murder!!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short, you are not in, but out,&rsquo; cried Polly,
in a burst of laughter; for Bell had leaned too far to the right,
and on bringing the other foot in, with its &lsquo;swift but
admirably steady&rsquo; motion, she gave a sudden lurch, pulled
the hammock entirely over herself and fell out head first on the
other side, leaving her feet tangled in its meshes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shall we help her out, Meg?&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t
deserve it, after that pompous oration and attempt to show off
her superior abilities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she always accepts
mercy more gracefully than justice.&nbsp; Heave ahoy, my
hearties!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bell was extricated, and looked sufficiently ashamed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are much obliged for the lesson,&rsquo; said
Margery, &lsquo;but the method is open to criticism; so I think
we&rsquo;ll manage in our ordinary savage way.&nbsp; We may not
be graceful or scientific, but we get in, which is the main
point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hammocks did not prove the easiest of nests, as the girls
had imagined.&nbsp; In fact, to be perfectly candid about the
matter, the wicked flea of California, which man pursueth but
seldom catcheth, is apt, on many a summer night, to interfere
shamelessly with slumber.&nbsp; On this particular night he was
fairly rampant, perhaps because sweet humanity on which to feed
was very scarce in that ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night, girls!&rsquo; called Jack, when matters
seemed to be finally settled for sleep.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bell, you
must keep one eye open, for the coyotes will be stealing down the
mountain in a jiffy, and yours is the first hammock in the
path.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; moaned
Bell,&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s why the girls gave me this one;
they knew very well that one victim always slakes the
animals&rsquo; thirst for blood.&nbsp; Well, let them come
on.&nbsp; I shiver with terror, but my only hope is that I may be
eaten in my sleep, if at all.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was a young party named Bell,<br />
Who slept out of doors for a spell;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked how she fared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she was scared,<br />
But otherwise doing quite well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall be able to drive Bell off her own field, with a little
practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go to sleep!&rsquo; roared Dr. Paul.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
your present condition of mind and body you are not fit for
poetry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just the point, sir,&rsquo; retorted Jack,
slyly, &lsquo;for, you remember, poets are not <i>fit</i>, but
<i>nascitur</i>,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; and he
retired under his blanket for protection.</p>
<p>But quiet seemed to be impossible: there were all sorts of
strange sounds; and the moon, too, was so splendid that they
almost felt as if they were lying beneath the radiance of a
calcium light; while in the dark places, midst the branches of
thick foliage, the owls hooted gloomily.&nbsp; If you had
happened to be an owl in that vicinity, you might have heard not
only the feverish tossing to and fro of the girls in the
hammocks, but many dismal sighs and groans from Dr. Winship and
the boys; for the bare ground is, after all, more rheumatic than
romantic, and they too tumbled from side to side, seeking
comfort.</p>
<p>But at midnight quiet slumber had descended upon them, and
they presented a funny spectacle enough to one open-eyed
watcher.&nbsp; A long slender sycamore log was extended before
the fire, and constituted their pillow; on this their heads
reposed, each decorated with a tightly fitting silk handkerchief;
then came a compact, papoose-like roll of grey blanket,
terminated by a pair of erect feet, whose generous proportions
soared to different heights.&nbsp; There was a little snoring,
too; perhaps the log was hollow.</p>
<p>At midnight you might have seen a quaintly despondent little
figure, whose curly head issued from a hooded cloak, staggering
hopelessly from a hammock, and seating herself on a mossy
stump.&nbsp; From the limpness of her attitude and the pathetic
expression of her eyes, I fear Polly was reviewing former happy
nights spent on spring-beds; and at this particular moment the
realities of camping-out hardly equalled her anticipations.&nbsp;
Whatever may have been her feelings, however, they were promptly
stifled when a certain insolent head reared itself from its
blanket-roll, and a hoarse voice cackled, &lsquo;Pretty
Polly!&nbsp; Polly want a ca&ntilde;on?&rsquo;&nbsp; At this
insult Miss Oliver wrapped her drapery about her and strode to
her hammock with the air of a tragedy queen.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LIFE IN THE CA&Ntilde;ON&mdash;THE HEIR
APPARENT LOSES HIMSELF</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Know&rsquo;st thou the land where the
lemon-trees bloom,<br />
Where the gold orange glows in the green thicket&rsquo;s
gloom;<br />
Where the wind, ever soft, from the blue heaven blows,<br />
And groves are of myrtle, and olive, and rose?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next morning, as we have
seen, they named their summer home Camp Chaparral, and for a week
or more they were the very busiest colony of people under the
sun; for it takes a deal of hard work and ingenuity to make a
comfortable and beautiful dwelling-place in the forest.</p>
<p>The best way of showing you how they accomplished this is to
describe the camp after it was nearly finished.</p>
<p>The two largest bedroom tents were made of bright awning
cloth, one of red and white, the other of blue and white, both
gaily decorated with braid.&nbsp; They were pitched under the
same giant oak, and yet were nearly forty feet apart; that of the
girls having a canvas floor.&nbsp; They were not quite willing to
sleep on the ground, so they had brought empty bed-sacks with
them, and Pancho&rsquo;s first duty after his arrival had been to
drive to a neighbouring ranch for a great load of straw.</p>
<p>In a glorious tree near by was a &lsquo;sky parlour,&rsquo;
arranged by a few boards nailed high up in the leafy branches,
and reached from below by a primitive ladder.&nbsp; This was the
favourite sitting-room of the girls by day, and served for
Pancho&rsquo;s bedroom at night.&nbsp; It was beautiful enough to
be fit shelter for all the woodland nymphs, with its festoons of
mistletoe and wild grape-vines; but Pancho was rather an
unappreciative tenant, even going so far as to snore in the
sacred place!</p>
<p>Just beyond was a card-room,&mdash;imagine it&mdash;in which a
square board, nailed on a low stump, served for a table, where
Dr. Paul and the boys played many a game of crib, backgammon, and
checkers.&nbsp; Here, too, all Elsie&rsquo;s letters were written
and Bell&rsquo;s nonsense verses, and here was the identical spot
where Jack Howard, that mischievous knight of the brush,
perpetrated those modern travesties on the &lsquo;William Henry
pictures,&rsquo; for Elsie&rsquo;s delectation.</p>
<p>The dressing-room was reached by a path cut through bushes to
a charming little pool.&nbsp; Here were unmistakable evidences of
feminine art: looking-glasses hanging to trees, snowy
wash-cloths, each bearing its owner&rsquo;s initials, adorning
the shrubs, while numerous towels waved in the breeze.&nbsp;
Between two trees a thin board was nailed, which appeared to be
used, as nearly as the woodpeckers could make out, as a
toothbrush rack.&nbsp; In this, Philip, the skilful carpenter,
had bored the necessary number of holes, and each one contained a
toothbrush tied with a gorgeous ribbon.</p>
<p>In this secluded spot Bell was wont to marshal every morning
the entire force of &lsquo;the toothbrush brigade&rsquo;; and,
conducting the drill with much ingenuity, she would take her
victims through a long series of military man&oelig;uvres
arranged for the toothbrush.&nbsp; Oh, the gaspings, the chokings
and stranglings, which occurred when she mounted a rock by the
edge of the pool, and after calling in tones of thunder,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Brush, brothers, brush with care!<br />
Brush in the presence of the commandaire!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ordered her unwilling privates to polish their innocent molars
to the tune of &lsquo;Hail, Columbia,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Auld Lang
Syne&rsquo;!&nbsp; And if they became mutinous, it was Geoffrey
who reduced them to submission, and ordered them to brush for
three mornings to the tune of &lsquo;Bluebells of Scotland&rsquo;
as a sign of loyalty to their commander.</p>
<p>As for the furnishing of the camp, there were impromptu stools
and tables made of packing-boxes and trunks, all covered with
bright Turkey-red cotton; there were no less than three rustic
lounges and two arm-chairs made from manzanita branches, and a
Queen Anne bedstead was being slowly constructed, day by day, by
the ambitious boys for their beloved Elsie.</p>
<p>One corner of each tent was curtained off for a bath-room,
another for a clothes-press, and there were a dozen devices for
comfort, as Dr. Winship was opposed to any more inconvenience
than was strictly necessary.&nbsp; Dr. and Mrs. Winship and
little Dicky occupied one tent, the boys another, and the girls a
third.</p>
<p>When Bell, Polly, and Margery emerged from their tent on the
second morning, they were disagreeably surprised to see a large
placard over the front entrance, bearing the insolent
inscription, &lsquo;Tent Chatter.&rsquo;&nbsp; They said nothing;
but on the night after, a committee of two stole out and glued a
companion placard, &lsquo;Tent Clatter,&rsquo; over the door of
their masculine neighbours.&nbsp; And to tell the truth, one was
as well deserved as the other; for if there was generally a
subdued hum of conversation in the one, there never failed to be
a perfect din and uproar in the other.</p>
<p>Under a great sycamore-tree stood the dining-table, which
consisted of two long, wide boards placed together upon a couple
of barrels; and not far away was the brush kitchen, which should
have been a work of art, for it represented the combined genius
of American, Mexican, and Chinese carpenters, Dr. Winship,
Pancho, and Hop Yet having laboured in its erection.&nbsp; It
really answered the purpose admirably, and looked quite like a
conventional California kitchen; that is, it was ten feet square,
and contained a table, a stove, and a Chinaman.</p>
<p>The young people, by the way, had fought bitterly against the
stove, protesting with all their might against taking it.&nbsp;
Polly and Jack declared that they would starve sooner than eat
anything that hadn&rsquo;t been cooked over a camp-fire.&nbsp;
Bell and Philip said that they should stand in front of it all
the time, for fear somebody would ride through the ca&ntilde;on
and catch them camping out with a stove.&nbsp; Imagine such a
situation; it made them blush.&nbsp; Margery said she wished
people weren&rsquo;t quite so practical, and wouldn&rsquo;t ruin
nature by introducing such ugly and unnecessary things.&nbsp; She
intended to point the moral by drawing a picture of Adam and Eve
in the garden of Eden,&mdash;Eve bending over a cook-stove and
Adam peeling apples with a machine.&nbsp; Geoffrey scoffed at
Margery&rsquo;s sentimentalism, put on his most trying air, and
declared that if he had his pork and onions served up &lsquo;hot
and reg&rsquo;lar,&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t care how she had her
victuals cooked.</p>
<p>They were all somewhat appeased, however, when they found that
Dr. Winship was as anxious as they for an evening camp-fire, and
merely insisted upon the stove because it simplified the
cookery.&nbsp; Furthermore, being an eminently just man, he
yielded so far as to give them permission to prepare their own
meals on a private camp-fire whenever they desired; and this
effectually stopped the argument, for no one was willing to pay
so heavy a price for effect.</p>
<p>The hammocks, made of gaily-coloured cords, were slung in
various directions a short distance from the square tent, which,
being the family sitting-room, was the centre of
attraction.&nbsp; It was arranged with a gay canopy, twenty feet
square.&nbsp; Three sides were made by hanging full curtains of
awning cloth from redwood rods by means of huge brass
rings.&nbsp; These curtains were looped back during the day and
dropped after dark, making a cosy and warm interior from which to
watch the camp-fire on cool evenings.</p>
<p>As for the Ca&ntilde;on de Las Flores itself, this little
valley of the flowers, it was beautiful enough in every part to
inspire an artist&rsquo;s pencil or a poet&rsquo;s pen; so quiet
and romantic it was, too, it might almost have been under a
spell,&mdash;the home of some sleepy, enchanted princess waiting
the magic kiss of a princely lover.&nbsp; It reached from the
ocean to the mountains, and held a thousand different pictures on
which to feast the eye; for Dame Nature deals out beauty with a
lavish hand in this land of perpetual summer, song, and
sunshine.&nbsp; There were many noble oak-trees, some hung
profusely with mistletoe, and others with the long, Spanish
greybeard moss, that droops from the branches in silvery lines,
like water spray.&nbsp; Sometimes, in the moonlight, it winds
about the oak like a shroud, and then again like a filmy bridal
veil, or drippings of mist from a frozen tree.</p>
<p>Here and there were open tracts of ground between the clumps
of trees, like that in which the tents were pitched,&mdash;sunny
places, where the earth was warm and dry, and the lizards blinked
sleepily under the stones.</p>
<p>Farther up the ca&ntilde;on were superb bay-trees, with their
glossy leaves and aromatic odour, and the madro&ntilde;o, which,
with its blood-red skin, is one of the most beautiful of
California trees, having an open growth, like a maple, bright
green lustrous leaves, and a brilliant red bark, which peels off
at regular seasons, giving place to a new one of delicate
pea-green.</p>
<p>There were no birches with pure white skin, or graceful elms,
or fluffy pussy willows, but so many beautiful foreign things
that it would seem ungrateful to mourn those left behind in the
dear New England woods; and as for flowers, there are no yellow
and purple violets, fragile anemones, or blushing Mayflowers, but
in March the hillsides are covered with red, in April flushed
with pink and blue, in May brilliant with yellow blossoms; and in
the ca&ntilde;ons, where the earth is moist, there are flowers
all the year.</p>
<p>And then the girls would never forgive me if I should forget
the superb yucca, or Spanish bayonet, which is as beautiful as a
tropical queen.&nbsp; Its tall, slender stalk has no twigs or
branches, but its leaves hang down from the top like
bayonet-blades; and oh, there rises from the centre of them such
a stately princess of a flower, like a tree in itself, laden with
cream-white, velvety, fragrant blossoms.</p>
<p>The boys often climbed the hillsides and brought home these
splendid treasures, which were placed in pails of water at the
tent doors, to shed their luxuriant beauty and sweetness in the
air for days together.&nbsp; They brought home quantities of
Spanish moss, and wild clematis, and manzanita berries too, with
which to decorate the beloved camp; and even Dicky trotted back
with his arms full of gorgeous blossoms and grasses, which he
arranged with great taste and skill in mugs, bottles, and cans on
the dining-table.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you see what a charming place it was?&nbsp; And I
have not begun to tell you the half yet; for there was always a
soft wind stirring the leaves in dreamy music, and above and
through this whispered sound you heard the brook splashing over
its pebbly bed,&mdash;splashing and splashing and laughing all it
possibly could, knowing it would speedily be dried up by the
thirsty August sun.&nbsp; Every few yards part of the stream
settled down contentedly into a placid little pool, while the
most inquisitive and restless little drops flowed noisily down to
see what was going on below.&nbsp; The banks were fringed with
graceful alders and poison-oak bushes, vivid in crimson and
yellow leaves, while delicate maiden-hair ferns grew in miniature
forests between the crevices of the rocks; yet, with the
practicality of Chinese human nature, Hop Yet used all this
beauty for a dish-pan and refrigerator!</p>
<p>Now, confess that, after having seen exactly how it looks, you
would like to rub a magic lamp, like Aladdin, and wish yourself
there with our merry young sextette.&nbsp; For California is a
lovely land and a strange one, even at this late day, when her
character has been nearly ruined by dreadful stories, or made
ridiculous by foolish ones.</p>
<p>When you were all babies in long clothes, some people used to
believe that there were nuggets of gold to be picked up in the
streets, and that in the flowery valleys, flowing with milk and
honey, there grew groves of beet-trees, and forests of cabbages,
and shady bowers of squash-vines; and they thought that through
these fertile valleys strode men of curious mien, wild bandits
and highway robbers, with red flannel shirts and many pockets
filled with playing-cards and revolvers and bowie-knives; and
that when you met these frightful persons and courteously asked
the time of day, they were apt to turn and stab you to the heart
by way of response.</p>
<p>Now, some of these things were true, and some were not, and
some will never happen again; for the towns and cities no longer
conduct themselves like headstrong young tomboys out on a lark,
but have grown into ancient and decorous settlements some
twenty-five or thirty years old.</p>
<p>Perhaps California isn&rsquo;t really so interesting since she
began to learn manners; but she is a land of wonders still, with
her sublime mountains and valleys; her precious metals; her
vineyards and orchards of lemons and oranges, figs, limes, and
nuts; her mammoth vegetables, each big enough for a newspaper
story; her celebrated trees, on the stumps of which
dancing-parties are given; her vultures; her grizzly bears; and
her people, drawn from every nook and corner of the
map&mdash;pink, yellow, blue, red, and green countries.&nbsp; And
though the story of California is not written, in all its
romantic details, in the school-books of to-day, it is a part of
the poetry of our late American history, full of strange and
thrilling scenes, glowing with interest and dramatic fire.</p>
<p>I know a little girl who crossed the plains in that great
ungeneraled army of fifteen or twenty thousand people that made
the long and weary journey to the land of gold in 1849.&nbsp; She
tells her children now of the strange, long days and months in
the ox-team, passing through the heat and dust of alkali deserts,
fording rivers, and toiling over steep mountains.&nbsp; She tells
them how at night she often used to lie awake, curled up in her
grey blanket, and hear the men talking together of the gold
treasures they were to dig from the ground&mdash;treasures, it
seemed to her childish mind, more precious than those of which
she read in The Arabian Nights.&nbsp; And from a little hole in
the canvas cover of the old emigrant wagon she used to see the
tired fathers and brothers, worn and footsore from their hard
day&rsquo;s tramp, some sleeping restlessly, and others guarding
the cattle or watching for Indians, who were always expected, and
often came; and the last thing at night, when her eyes were heavy
with sleep, she peered dreamily out into the darkness to see the
hundreds of gleaming camp-fires, which dotted the plain as far as
the eye could reach.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>You will have noticed that this first week of camp-life was a
quiet one, spent mostly by the young people in getting their
open-air home comfortably arranged, making conveniences of all
kinds, becoming acquainted with the ca&ntilde;on so far as they
could, and riding once or twice to neighbouring ranches for hay
or provisions.</p>
<p>Dr. Winship believed in a good beginning; and, as this was not
a week&rsquo;s holiday, but a summer campaign, he wanted his
young people to get fully used to the situation before
undertaking any of the exciting excursions in prospect.&nbsp; So,
before the week was over, they began to enjoy sound, dreamless
sleep on their hard straw beds, to eat the plain fare with
decided relish, to grow a little hardy and brown, and quite
strong and tough enough for a long tramp or horseback ride.</p>
<p>After a religious devotion to cold cream for a few nights,
Polly had signified her terrible intention of &lsquo;letting her
nose go.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I disown it!&rsquo; she cried,
peeping in her tiny mirror, and lighting up her too rosy tints
with a tallow candle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hideous objick, I defy
thee!&nbsp; Spot and speckle, yea, burn to a crisp, and shed thy
skin afterwards!&nbsp; I care not.&nbsp; Indeed, I shall be well
rid of thee, thou&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;thou&mdash;well, leopard,
for instance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One beautiful day followed another, each the exact counterpart
of the one that had preceded it; for California boys and girls
never have to say &lsquo;wind and weather permitting&rsquo; from
March or April until November.&nbsp; They always know what the
weather is going to do; and whether this is an advantage or not
is a difficult matter to settle conclusively.</p>
<p>New England boys affirm that they wouldn&rsquo;t live in a
country where it couldn&rsquo;t rain any day it felt like it, and
California lads retort that they are glad their dispositions are
not ruined by the freaks of New England weather.&nbsp; At all
events, it is a paradise for would-be campers, and any one who
should assert the contrary would meet with energetic opposition
from the loyal dwellers in Camp Chaparral.</p>
<p>Bell returned one day from a walk which she had taken by
herself, while the other girls were off on some errand with the
Doctor.&nbsp; After luncheon she drew them mysteriously into the
square tent, and lowered the curtains.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; Polly whispered, with an anxious
expression of countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you lost your gold
thimble again, or your temper, or have you discovered a silver
mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found,&rsquo; she answered mysteriously,
&lsquo;the most beautifully secret place you ever beheld.&nbsp;
It will be just the spot for us to write and study in when we
want to be alone; or it will even do for a theatre; and it is
scarcely more than half a mile up the ca&ntilde;on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you find it?&rsquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I was walking along by the brookside, I saw a snake
making its way through the bushes, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goodness!&rsquo; shrieked Polly, &lsquo;I shall not
write there, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goose!&nbsp; Just wait a minute.&nbsp; I looked at it,
and followed at a distance; it was a harmless little thing; and I
thought, for the fun of it, I would just push blindly on and see
what I should find, because we are for ever walking in the beaten
path, and I long for something new.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bad instinct,&rsquo; remarked Madge, &lsquo;and one
which will get you into trouble, so you should crush it in its
infancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I took up my dress and ploughed through the
chaparral, until I came, in about three minutes of scratching and
fighting, to an open circular place about as large as this
tent.&nbsp; It was exactly round, which is the curious part of
it; and in the centre was one stump, covered with moss and
surrounded by great white toadstools.&nbsp; How any one happened
to go in there and cut down a single tree I can&rsquo;t
understand, nor yet how they managed to bring out the tree
through the tangled brush.&nbsp; It is so strange that it seems
as if there must be a mystery about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Margery promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
tragedy of the darkest kind!&nbsp; Some cruel wretch has cut
down, in the pride and pomp of it beauty, one sycamore-tree; its
innocent life-blood has stained the ground, and given birth to
the white toadstools which mark the spot and testify to the
purity of the victim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued Bell, impressively, &lsquo;I
knew I could never find it again; and I wanted so much you should
see it that I took the ball of twine we always carry, unrolled
it, and dropped the thread all the way along to the brookside,
like Phrygia, or Melpomene, or Anemone, or whatever her name
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or Artesia, or Polynesia, or Euthanasia,&rsquo;
interrupted Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think the lady you mean is
Ariadne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ll take papa to see it, and
then we&rsquo;ll fit it up as a retreat.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it be
charming?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll call it the Lone Stump.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I like that; it makes me shiver!&rsquo; cried
Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to write an ode to it at
once.&nbsp; Ahem!&nbsp; It shall begin&mdash;let me
see&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O lonely tree,<br />
What cruel &ldquo;he&rdquo;<br />
Did lay thee low?<br />
Tell us the facts;<br />
Did cruel axe<br />
Abuse thee so?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Sublime!&nbsp; Second verse,&rsquo; said Bell slowly,
with pauses between the lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or did a gopher,<br />
The wicked loafer,<br />
Gnaw at thy base,<br />
And, doing so,<br />
Contrive to go,<br />
And leave no trace?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear!&rsquo; sighed Margery; &lsquo;if you will do
it, wait a minute.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O toadstools white,<br />
Pray give us light<br />
Upon the question.<br />
Did gopher gnaw,<br />
And live in awe<br />
Of indigestion?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; continued Bell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or did a man<br />
Malicious plan<br />
The good tree&rsquo;s ruin,<br />
And leave it so<br />
Convenient low,<br />
A seat for Bruin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For travelling grizzlies, you know.&nbsp; We may go there and
see a hungry creature making a stump-speech, while an admiring
audience of grasshoppers and tarantulas seat themselves in a
circle on the toadstools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charming prospect!&rsquo; said Madge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I care to visit the Lone Stump or pass my
mornings there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, dear child; it is just like every other part
of the ca&ntilde;on, only a little more lonely.&nbsp; It is not
half a mile from camp, and hardly a dozen steps from the place
where the boys go so often to shoot quail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the girls.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must
go there to-morrow morning; and perhaps we&rsquo;d better not
tell the boys,&mdash;they are so peculiar.&nbsp; Jack will
certainly interfere with us in some way, if he hears about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now let us take our books and run down by the pool for
an hour or two,&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa and the boys
are all off shooting, and mamma is lying down.&nbsp; We can have
a cool, quiet time; the sunshine is so hot here by the
tents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, they departed, as they often did, for one of the
prolonged chats in which school-girls are wont to indulge, and
which so often, too, are but idle, senseless chatter.</p>
<p>These young people, however, had been fortunate in having the
wisest and most loving guardianship, so that all their happy
young lives had been spent to good purpose.&nbsp; They had not
shirked study, and so their minds were stocked with useful
information; they had read carefully and digested thoroughly
whatever they had read, so that they possessed a good deal of
general knowledge.&nbsp; The girls were bright, sensible,
industrious little women, who tried to be good, too, in the
old-fashioned sense of the word; and full of fun, nonsense, and
chatter as they were among themselves, they never forgot to be
modest and unassuming.</p>
<p>The boys were pretty well in earnest about life, too, with
good ambitions and generous aspirations.&nbsp; They had all been
studying with Dr. Winship for nearly two years; and that means a
great deal, for he was a real teacher, entering into the lives of
his pupils, sympathising with them in every way, and leading
them, through the study of nature, of human beings, and of God,
to see the beauty and meaning of life.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Strong, of course, was older than the rest, having
completed his junior year at college; but Dr. Winship, who was
his guardian, thought it wiser for him to rest a year and come to
him in California, as his ambition and energy had already led him
into greater exertions than his age or strength warranted.&nbsp;
He was now studying medicine with the good Doctor, but would go
back to the &lsquo;land of perpetual pie&rsquo; in the fall and
complete his college course.</p>
<p>A splendid fellow he was,&mdash;so earnest, thoughtful, and
wise; so gravely tender in all his ways to Aunt Truth, who was
the only mother he had ever known; so devoted to Dr. Winship, who
loved him as his own elder son.</p>
<p>What will Geoffrey Strong be as a man?&nbsp; The twig is bent,
and it is safe to predict how the tree will incline.&nbsp; His
word will be as good as his bond; he will be a good physician,
for his eye is quick to see suffering, and his hand ready to
relieve it; little children with feverish cheeks and tired eyes
will love to clasp his cool, strong sand; he will be gentle as a
woman, yet thoroughly manly, as he is now, for he has made the
most of his golden youth, and every lad who does that will have a
golden manhood and a glorious old age.</p>
<p>As for Philip Noble, he was a dear, good, trustworthy lad too;
kindly, generous, practical, and industrious; a trifle slow and
reserved, perhaps, but full of common sense,&mdash;the kind of
sense which, after all, is most uncommon.</p>
<p>Bell once said: &lsquo;This is the difference between Philip
and Geoffrey,&mdash;one does, and the other is.&nbsp; Geoff is
the real Simon-pure ideal which we praise Philip for trying to
be,&rsquo;&mdash;a very good description for a little maiden
whose bright eyes had only looked into life for sixteen
summers.</p>
<p>And now we come to Jack Howard, who never kept still long
enough for any one to write a description of him.&nbsp; To
explain how he differed from Philip or Geoffrey would be like
bringing the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer together for
purposes of comparison.</p>
<p>If there were a horseback ride, Jack rode the wildest colt,
was oftenest thrown and least often hurt; if a fishing-party,
Jack it was who caught all the fish, though he made more noise
than any one else, and followed no rules laid down in <i>The
Complete Angler</i>.</p>
<p>He was very often in trouble; but his misdemeanours were those
of pure mischief, and were generally atoned for when it was
possible.&nbsp; He excelled in all out-of-door sports.&nbsp; And
indeed, if his prudence had at all kept pace with his ability, he
might have done remarkable things in almost any direction; but he
constantly overshot the mark, and people looked to him for the
dazzling brilliancy and uncertainty of a meteor, but never for
the steady glow of a fixed star.</p>
<p>Just now, Jack was a good deal sobered, and appeared at his
very best.&nbsp; The teaching of Dr. Paul and the companionship
of Geoffrey had done much for him, while the illness of his
sister Elsie, who was the darling of his heart, acted constantly
as a sort of curb upon him; for he loved her with all the ardour
and passion which he gave to everything else.&nbsp; You might be
fearful of Jack&rsquo;s high spirits and riotous mirth, of his
reckless actions and heedless jokes, but you could scarcely keep
from admiring the boy; for he was brave and handsome and winsome
enough to charm the very birds off the bush, as Aunt Truth
acknowledged, after giving him a lecture for some
misdemeanour.</p>
<p>The three girls made their way a short distance up the
ca&ntilde;on to a place which they called Prospect Pool, because
it was so entirely shut in from observation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear old Geoff!&rsquo; said Bell, throwing her shawl
over a rock and opening her volume of Carlyle.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
has gone all through this for me, and written nice little remarks
on the margin,&mdash;explanations and things, and interrogations
where he thinks I won&rsquo;t know what is meant and had better
find out,&mdash;bless his heart!&nbsp; What have you brought,
Margery?&nbsp; By the way, you must move your seat away from that
clump of poison-oak bushes; we can&rsquo;t afford to have any
accidents which will interfere with our fun.&nbsp; We have all
sorts of new remedies, but I prefer that the boys should
experiment with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the softest seat here, too,&rsquo; grumbled
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must get the boys to cut these bushes
down.&nbsp; Why, you haven&rsquo;t any book, you lazy
Polly.&nbsp; Are you going to sleep, or shall you chatter and
prevent our reading?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is a
doughnut which I propose to send down the red pathway of fate;
and here a pencil and paper with which I am going to begin our
round-robin letter to Elsie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good!&nbsp; She has only had notes from
Jack and one letter from us, which, if I remember right, had
nothing in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks!&nbsp; I wrote it,&rsquo; sniffed Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I meant it had no news&mdash;no account of
things, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t descend to writing news, and I
leave accounts to the butcher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop quarrelling, girls!&nbsp; This is my plan: I will
begin in my usual rockety style, sometimes maliciously called the
Pollyoliver method; Margery will take up the thread sedately;
Bell will plunge in with a burst of enthusiasm and seventeen
adjectives, followed by a verse of poor poetry; Geoff will do the
sportive or instructive, just as he happens to feel; and Phil
will wind up the letter by some practical details which will
serve as a key to all the rest.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it be a box of
literary bonbons for her to read in bed, poor darling!&nbsp; Let
me see!&nbsp; I represent the cayenne lozenges, sharp but
impressive; Margery will do for jujube paste, which I
adore,&mdash;mild, pleasant, yielding, delicious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sticky and insipid!&rsquo; murmured Madge,
plaintively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, my dear.&nbsp; Bell stands for the
peppermints; Jack for chocolates, &ldquo;the ladies&rsquo;
delight&rdquo;; Geoffrey for a wine-drop, altogether good, but
sweetest in its heart; Phil&mdash;let me see!&nbsp; Phil is
like&mdash;what is he like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more like candy than a cold boiled potato,&rsquo;
said his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is <i>candid</i>,&rsquo; suggested Bell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us call him rock-candy, pure, healthful, and far from
soft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or marshmallow,&rsquo; said Margery, &lsquo;good, but
tough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or caramel,&rsquo; laughed Polly; &lsquo;it always
sticks to a point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, gentle creatures,&rsquo; said a voice from the
bushes on the other side of the pool, and Phil stalked out from
his covert, like a wounded deer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long have you been in there, villain?&rsquo; cried
Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ever since lunch; but I only waked from a sound sleep
some twenty minutes ago.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard a most
instructive conversation&mdash;never been more amused in my life;
don&rsquo;t know whether I prefer being a cold boiled potato or a
ladies&rsquo;-delight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t any choice,&rsquo; snapped Polly, a
trifle embarrassed at having been overheard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it was my own sister who called me a c.
b. p. (the most loathsome thing in existence, by the way),
because sisters never appreciate their brothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t call you a c. b. p.,&rsquo; remonstrated
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;I said you were no more like candy than a
c. b. p.&nbsp; There is a difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there?&nbsp; My poor brain fails to grasp it.&nbsp;
But never mind; I&rsquo;ll forgive you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listeners never hear good of themselves,&rsquo; sighed
Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you writing a copy-book, Miss Oliver?&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t want to listen; it was very painful to my feelings,
but I was too sleepy to move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now our afternoon is gone, and we have not read a
word,&rsquo; sighed little Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never met two
such chatterboxes as you and Polly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to hear us talk is a liberal education,&rsquo;
retorted Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; said Philip, dryly, &lsquo;Come,
I&rsquo;ll take the books and shawls.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nearly
five o&rsquo;clock, and we shall hear Hop Yet blowing his lusty
dinner-horn presently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go off shooting with the
others?&rsquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stayed at home so they&rsquo;d get a chance to
shoot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, do you mean you always scare the game away?&rsquo;
inquired Polly, artlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I mean that I always do all the shooting, and the
others get discouraged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clasp hands over the bloody chasm,&rsquo; said Bell,
&lsquo;and let us smoke the pipe of peace at dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Philip and Bell came through the trees, and, as they neared
the camp, saw Aunt Truth sitting at the door of Tent Chatter,
looking the very picture of comfort, as she drew her
darning-needle in and out of an unseemly rent in one of
Dicky&rsquo;s stockings.&nbsp; Margery and Polly came up just
behind, and dropped into her lap some beautiful branches of wild
azalea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you have a pleasant walk, dears?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed, dear auntie.&nbsp; Now, just hold your
head perfectly still, while we decorate you for dinner.&nbsp; We
will make Uncle Doc&rsquo;s eyes fairly pop with
admiration.&nbsp; Have you been lonely without us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, not a bit.&nbsp; You see there has been a good deal
of noise about here, and I felt as if I were not alone.&nbsp; Hop
Yet has been pounding soap-root in the kitchen, and I hear the
sound of Pancho&rsquo;s axe in the distance,&mdash;the Doctor
asked him to chop wood for the camp-fire.&nbsp; Was Dicky any
trouble?&nbsp; Where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, darling mother, are you crazy?&rsquo; asked
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you think a moment, he was in the hammock
and you were lying down in the tent when we started.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I certainly thought I heard him ask to go with
you,&rsquo; said Mrs. Winship, in rather an alarmed tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he did; but I told him it was too far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear that; in fact, I was half asleep; I
was not feeling well.&nbsp; Ask Hop Yet; he has been in the
kitchen all the afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hop Yet replied, with discouraging tranquillity, &lsquo;Oh, I
no know.&nbsp; I no sabe Dicky; he allee time lun loun camp; I no
look; too muchee work.&nbsp; I chop hash&mdash;Dicky come in
kitch&rsquo;&mdash;make heap work&mdash;no good.&nbsp; I tell him
go long&mdash;he go; bime-by you catchum; you see.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon he gracefully skinned an onion, and burst into a
Chinese song, with complete indifference as to whether Dicky
lived or died.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he is with Pancho; I&rsquo;ll run and
see!&rsquo; cried Polly, dashing swiftly in the direction of the
sky-parlour.&nbsp; But after a few minutes she ran back, with a
serious face.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not there; Pancho has not
seen him since lunch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just happened to think,&rsquo; said
pale Aunt Truth, &lsquo;that papa came into the tent for some
cartridges, after you left, and of course he took Dick with
him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose it is any use to worry.&nbsp; He
always does come out right; and I have told him so many times
never on any account to go away from the camp alone that he
surely would not do it.&nbsp; Papa and the boys will be home
soon, now.&nbsp; It is nearly six o&rsquo;clock, and I told them
that I would blow the horn at six, as usual.&nbsp; If they are
too far away to hear it, they will know the time by the
sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Bell, anxiously, &lsquo;I hope it is
all right.&nbsp; Papa is so strict that he won&rsquo;t be late
himself.&nbsp; Did all the boys go with him, mamma?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, all but Philip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, then Dicky must be with them,&rsquo; said Margery,
consolingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Geoffrey always takes him wherever he
can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the girls went into the tent to begin their dinner toilet,
which consisted in carefully brushing burrs and dust from their
pretty dresses, and donning fresh collars and stockings, with low
ties of russet leather, which Polly declared belonged only to the
stage conception of a camping costume; then, with smoothly
brushed hair and bright flower-knots at collar and belt, they
looked charming enough to grace any drawing-room in the land.</p>
<p>The horn was blown again at six o&rsquo;clock, Aunt Truth
standing at the entrance of the path which led up the
ca&ntilde;on, shading her anxious eyes from the light of the
setting sun.&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they come!&rsquo; she cried, joyously, as the
welcome party appeared in sight, guns over shoulder, full
game-bags, and Jack and Geoff with a few rabbits and quail
hanging over their arms.</p>
<p>The girls rushed out of the tent.&nbsp; Bell took in the whole
group with one swift glance, and then turned to her mother, who,
like most mothers, believed the worst at once, and grew paler as
she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, where is little Dick?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dick!&nbsp; Why, my dear, he has not been out with
us.&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t take him?&rsquo; faltered
Aunt Truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I am.&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t
any one know where the child is?&rsquo; looking at the frightened
group.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know, uncle,&rsquo; said Geoffrey, &lsquo;we
started out at three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I noticed Dicky playing
with his blocks in our tent, and said good-bye to him.&nbsp; Did
you see him when you came back for the cartridges?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I did; he called me to look at his dog making
believe go to sleep in the hammock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We girls went down to the pool soon after that,&rsquo;
said Bell, tearfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;He asked to go with us, and I
told him it was too far, and that he&rsquo;d better stay with
mamma, who would be all alone.&nbsp; He said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; so
sweetly I couldn&rsquo;t mistrust him.&nbsp; Oh, was it my fault,
papa?&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t say it was!&rsquo; and she burst
into a passion of sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, my child, of course it was not.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t cry; we shall find him.&nbsp; Go and look about the
camp, Geoff, while we consider for a minute what to
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there is any fault, it is mine, for going to
sleep,&rsquo; said poor Aunt Truth; &lsquo;but I never dreamed he
would dare to wander off alone, my poor little disobedient
darling!&nbsp; What shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you spoken to Pancho and Hop Yet?&rsquo; asked
Phil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; they have seen nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hop Yet just at this moment issued from his kitchen with an
immense platter of mutton-stew and dumplings, which he deposited
on the table.&nbsp; On being questioned again, he answered as
before, with the greatest serenity, intimating that Dicky would
come home &lsquo;heap bime-by&rsquo; when he got &lsquo;plenty
hungly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed to think a lost boy or two in a
family rather a trifle than otherwise, and wound up his unfeeling
remarks with the practical one, &lsquo;Dinner all leady; you no
eat mutton, he get cold!&nbsp; Misser Wins&rsquo;, I no find
pickle; you catchum!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he would care if we all died
right before his eyes,&rsquo; muttered Polly, angrily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should just like to see a Chinaman&rsquo;s heart once,
and find out whether it was made of resin, or cuttle-fish, or
what.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Phil, as Dr. Winship came through the
trees from the card-room, &lsquo;we must start out this instant,
and of course we can find him somehow, somewhere; he hasn&rsquo;t
been gone over two hours, and he couldn&rsquo;t walk far,
that&rsquo;s certain.&nbsp; Now, Uncle Doc, shall we all go
different ways, and leave the girls here to see if he
doesn&rsquo;t turn up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, papa,&rsquo; cried Bell, do not leave us at
home!&nbsp; We can hunt as well as any one; we know every foot of
the ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; Let me go with Geoff, and we&rsquo;ll
follow the brook trail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; Now, mamma, Pancho and I will go down
to the main road, and you wait patiently here.&nbsp; Make all the
noise you can, children; and the one who finds him must come back
to the camp and blow the horn.&nbsp; Hop Yet, we go now; if Dicky
comes back, you blow the horn yourself, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All light, boss.&nbsp; You eat um dinner now; then go
bime-by; mutton heap cold; you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner!&rsquo; shouted Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;Confound your
impudence!&nbsp; If you say dinner again, I&rsquo;ll cut the
queue off your stupid head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; murmured Polly, giving a savage punch to
her blue Tam o&rsquo; Shanter cap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack, Jack!&rsquo; remonstrated Aunt Truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, dear auntie; but the callous old heathen makes
me so mad I can&rsquo;t contain myself.&nbsp; Come, Margery,
let&rsquo;s be off.&nbsp; Get your shawl; and hurrah for the one
who comes back to blow the horn first!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager you
ten to one I&rsquo;ll have Dick in auntie&rsquo;s lap inside the
hour!&rsquo;&mdash;at which Aunt Truth&rsquo;s eyes brightened,
and she began to take heart again.&nbsp; But as he tore past the
brush kitchen and out into the woods, dragging Madge after him at
a breathless pace, he shut his lips together rather grimly,
saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give five hundred dollars
(s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; I had a cent) to see that youngster safe
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me one thing, Jack,&rsquo; said Margery, her teeth
chattering with nervousness; &lsquo;are there any animals in this
ca&ntilde;on that would attack him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course it is possible that a California lion or
a wild-cat might come down to the brook to drink&mdash;they have
been killed hereabouts&mdash;but I hardly believe it is likely;
and neither do I believe they would be apt to hurt him, any way,
for he would never attack them, you know.&nbsp; What I am afraid
of is that he has tumbled over the rocks somewhere in climbing,
or tangled himself up in the chaparral.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
have made off with a pistol, could he?&nbsp; He is up to all such
tricks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently the ca&ntilde;on began to echo with strange sounds,
which I have no doubt sent the owls, birds, and rabbits into fits
of terror; for the boys had whistles and pistols, while Polly had
taken a tin pan and a hammer.&nbsp; She had gone with Phil out
behind the thicket of manzanita bushes, and they both stood
motionless, undecided where to go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Phil, I can&rsquo;t help it; I must cry, I am so
frightened.&nbsp; Let me sit down a second.&nbsp; Yes, I know
it&rsquo;s an ant-hill, and I shouldn&rsquo;t care if it were a
hornets&rsquo; nest&mdash;I deserve to be stung.&nbsp; What do
you think I said to Margery this morning?&nbsp; That Dicky was a
perfect little marplot, and spoiled all our fun, and I wished he
were in the bottom of the Red Sea; and then I called him a
k-k-k-ill-joy!&rsquo; and Polly buried her head in her blue Tam,
and cried a good, honest, old-fashioned cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, chirk up, poor little soul, and don&rsquo;t you
fret over a careless speech, that meant nothing at all.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve wished him in the Red Sea more than once, but
I&rsquo;m blessed if I ever do it again.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s
go over yonder, where we caught the young owl; Dicky may have
wanted to try that little game again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went on, calling, listening, then struggling on again,
more anxious every moment, but not so thoroughly dazed as Bell,
who had rocked her baby-brother in his cradle, and to whom he was
the embodiment of every earthly grace, if not of every heavenly
virtue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might have known this would happen,&rsquo; she said,
miserably.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is so careless that, if we ever find
him again, we must keep him tied to something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care of your steps, dear,&rsquo; said Geoff,
&lsquo;and munch this cracker, or you won&rsquo;t have strength
enough to go on with me.&nbsp; I wish it were not getting so
dark; the moment the sun gets behind these mountain-tops the
light seems to vanish in an instant.&mdash;Dick-y!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think of the poor darling out in this
darkness&mdash;hungry, frightened, and alone,&rsquo; sighed
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s past his bed-time now.&nbsp; Oh,
why did we ever come to stay in this horrible place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not blame the place, dear; we thought it the
happiest in the world this morning.&nbsp; Here we are by the
upper pool, and the path stops.&nbsp; Which way had we better
go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been here before to-day,&rsquo; said Bell;
&lsquo;we might follow the trail I made.&nbsp; But where is my
string?&nbsp; Light a match, Geoff, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What string?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I found a beautiful spot this morning, and,
fearing I shouldn&rsquo;t remember the way again, I took out my
ball of twine and dropped a white line all the way back, like
Ariadne; but I don&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; Where can it have
disappeared&mdash;unless Jack or Phil took it to tease
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; I&rsquo;ve been with them all day.&nbsp; Perhaps
a snake has swallowed it.&nbsp; Come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But a bright idea had popped into Bell&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want to go that way, Geoff, dear; it&rsquo;s as good as
any other, and there are flowers just the other side, in an open,
sunny place; perhaps he found them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right; let&rsquo;s go ahead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The trouble is, I don&rsquo;t know which way to
go.&nbsp; Here is the rock; I remember it was a spotted one, with
tall ferns growing beside it.&nbsp; Now I went&mdash;let me
see&mdash;this way,&rsquo; and they both plunged into the thick
brush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bell, Bell, this is utter nonsense!&rsquo; cried
Geoff.&nbsp; &lsquo;No child could crawl through this
tangle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dicky could crawl through anything in this universe, if
it was the wrong thing; he isn&rsquo;t afraid of beast, bird, or
fish, and he positively enjoys getting scratched,&rsquo; said
Bell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what had become of this small hero, and what was he
doing?&nbsp; He was last seen in the hammock, playing with the
long-suffering terrier, Lubin, who was making believe go to
sleep.&nbsp; It proved to be entirely a make-believe; for, at the
first loosening of Dicky&rsquo;s strangling hold upon his throat,
he tumbled out of the hammock and darted into the woods.&nbsp;
Dicky followed, but Lubin was fleet of foot, and it was a
desperate and exciting race for full ten minutes.</p>
<p>At length, as Lubin heard his little master&rsquo;s gleeful
laugh, he realised that his anger was a thing of the past;
consequently, he wheeled about and ran into Dicky&rsquo;s
outstretched arms, licking his face and hands exuberantly in the
joy of complete forgiveness.</p>
<p>By this time the voice of conscience in Dicky&rsquo;s
soul&mdash;and it was a very, very still, small one on all
occasions&mdash;was entirely silenced.&nbsp; He strayed into a
sunny spot, and picked flowers enough to trim his little sailor
hat, probably divining that this was what lost children in
Sunday-school books always did, and it would be dishonourable not
to keep up the superstition.&nbsp; Then he built a fine, strong
dam of stones across the brook, wading to and fro without the
bother of taking off his shoes and stockings, and filled his hat
with rocks and sunk it to the bottom for a wharf, keeping his
hat-band to tie an unhappy frog to a bit of bark, and setting him
afloat as the captain of a slave-ship.&nbsp; When, at length, the
struggling creature freed himself from his bonds and leaped into
the pool, Dicky played that he was a drowning child, and threw
Lubin into the water to rescue him.</p>
<p>In these merry antics the hours flew by unnoticed; he had
never been happier in his life, and it flashed through his mind
that if he were left entirely to himself he should always be
good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been a whole day offul good by my lone
self; haven&rsquo;t said one notty word or did one notty fing,
nor gotted scolded a singul wunst, did I, Lubin?&nbsp; I guess we
better live here; bettent we, Lubin?&nbsp; And ven we wunt git
stuck inter bed fur wettin&rsquo; our feets little teenty mites
of wet ev&rsquo;ry singul night all the livelong days, will we,
Lubin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this was a long period of reflection for Master Dicky, and
he capered on, farther and farther, the water sozzling
frightfully in his little copper-toed boots.&nbsp; At length he
sat down on a stone to rest himself, and, glancing aimlessly
about, his eyes fell on a white string, which he grasped with
alacrity, pulling its end from beneath the stone on which he
sat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Luby Winship, the anjulls gaved me this string fur ter
make an offul splendid tight harness for you, little Luby; and
you can drag big heavy stones.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t that be
nice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lubin looked doubtful, and wagged his tail dissentingly, as
much as to say that his ideas of angel ministrations were a
trifle different.</p>
<p>But there was no end to the string!&nbsp; How very, very
curious!&nbsp; Dicky wound and wound and crept and crept along,
until he was thoroughly tired but thoroughly determined to see it
through; and Lubin, meanwhile, had seized the first convenient
moment, after the mention of the harness, to retire to the
camp.</p>
<p>At length, oh joy! the tired and torn little man, following
carefully the leading-string, issued from the scratching bushes
into a clean, beautiful, round place, with a great
restful-looking stump in the centre, and round its base a small
forest of snowy toadstools.&nbsp; What could be a lovelier
surprise!&nbsp; Dicky clapped his hands in glee as he looked at
them, and thought of a little verse of poetry which Bell had
taught him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Some fairy umbrellas came up to-day<br />
Under the elm-tree, just over the way,<br />
And as we have had a shower of rain,<br />
The reason they came is made very plain:<br />
To-night is the woodland fairies&rsquo; ball,<br />
And drops from the elm-tree might on them fall,<br />
So little umbrellas wait for them here,<br />
And under their shelter they&rsquo;ll dance without fear.<br />
Take care where you step, nor crush them, I pray,<br />
For fear you will frighten the fairies away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; thought Dicky, in a trance of delight,
&lsquo;now I shall go to the fairies&rsquo; ball, and see
&rsquo;em dance under the cunning little teenty umberells; and
wunt they be mad at home when nobuddy can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em
but just only me!&nbsp; And then if that potry is a big whopper,
like that there uvver one&mdash;&rsquo;laddin-lamp story of
Bell&rsquo;s&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just pick evry white toadstool for
my papa&rsquo;s Sunday dinner, and she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t never
see a singul fairy dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he waited very patiently for a long, long time that seemed
like years, for Lubin had disappeared; and all at once it grew so
dark in this thickly-wooded place that Dicky&rsquo;s courage
oozed out in a single moment, without any previous warnings as to
its intention.&nbsp; The toadstools looked like the ghosts of
little past-and-gone fairy umbrellas in the darkness, and not a
single fairy couple came to waltz under their snowy canopies, or
exchange a furtive kiss beneath their friendly shadows.</p>
<p>Dicky thought the situation exceedingly gloomy, and, without
knowing it, followed the example of many older people, who, on
being deserted by man, experienced their first desire to find
favour with God.&nbsp; He was not in the least degree a saintly
child, but he felt instinctively that this was the proper time
for prayer; and not knowing anything appropriate to the occasion,
he repeated over and over again the time-worn plaint of
childhood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Now I lay me down to sleep,<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;<br />
If I should die before I wake,<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to take.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like older mortals of feeble faith, he looked for an immediate
and practical answer, in the shape, perhaps, of his mother, with
his little night-gown and bowl of bread and milk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sakes alive!&rsquo; he grumbled between his sobs,
&lsquo;they&rsquo;re the meanest fings I ever saw.&nbsp; How long
do they s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to wait for &rsquo;em
in this dark?&nbsp; When the bears have et me up in teenty snips,
then they&rsquo;ll be saterfied, I guess, and wisht they&rsquo;d
tookened gooder care of me&mdash;a little speck of a boy, lefted
out in this dark, bear-y place, all by his lone self.&nbsp;
O&mdash;oo&mdash;oo&mdash;oh!&rsquo; and he wound up with a
murderous yell, which had never failed before to bring the whole
family to his side.</p>
<p>His former prayer seeming to be in vain, he found a soft
place, brushed it as clean as possible, and with difficulty
bending his little stiff, scratched body into a kneeling
position, he prayed his nightly postscript to &lsquo;Now I lay
me&rsquo;: &lsquo;God bless papa, &rsquo;n&rsquo; mamma,
&rsquo;n&rsquo; Bell, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Jack, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
Madge, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Polly, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Phil,
&rsquo;n&rsquo; Geoff, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Elsie.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
realizing that he was in a perilous position, and it behoved him
to be as pious as possible, he added: &lsquo;And please bless
Pancho, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Hop Yet, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Lubin,
&rsquo;n&rsquo; the goat&mdash;not the wild goat up on the hill,
but my goat, what got sick to his stummick when I painted him
with black letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a dreadful calamity, to be sure, if the wrong goat had
been blessed by mistake!&nbsp; His whole duty performed, he
picked the toadstools for his papa&rsquo;s Sunday dinner, and,
leaning his head against the lone stump, cried himself to
sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p53b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But relief was near, though he little suspected it as he lay
in the sound, dreamless sleep which comes only to the truly
good.&nbsp; There was a crashing sound in the still darkness, and
Bell plunged through the thick underbrush with a cry of
delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is here!&nbsp; Dear, dear Geoff, he is all
here!&nbsp; I knew it, I knew it!&nbsp; Hurrah!&mdash;no, I
mean&mdash;thank God!&rsquo; she said softly as she stooped down
to kiss her mischievous little brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what a looking creature!&rsquo; exclaimed Geoff, as
he stooped over the recovered treasure.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, Bell,
his curls are glistening with pitch, his dress is torn into
ribbons, and his hands&mdash;ugh, how dirty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little darling, he is thoroughly used up,&rsquo;
whispered Bell, wiping tears of joy from her brown eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll run home like lightning to blow the horn;
and you carry Dicky, for he is too sleepy and stiff to walk; and,
Geoff&rsquo;&mdash;(here she laid an embarrassed hand on his
shoulder)&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll be awfully
cross, but you&rsquo;ll not mind it, will you?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
so worn-out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; laughed Geoff, as he dropped a brotherly
kiss on Bell&rsquo;s pale cheek.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve no
idea of letting you go alone; you&rsquo;re tired to death, and
you&rsquo;ll miss the path.&nbsp; I wish I could carry you
both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tired&mdash;afraid!&rsquo; cried Bell, with a ringing
laugh, while Dicky woke with a stare, and nestled on
Geoffrey&rsquo;s shoulder as if nothing had happened.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, now that this weight is lifted off my heart, I could
see a path in an untravelled forest!&nbsp; Good-bye, you dear,
darling, cruel boy!&nbsp; I must run, for every moment is
precious to mamma.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with one strangling hug,
which made Dicky&rsquo;s ribs crack, she dashed off.</p>
<p>Oh how joyously, how sweetly and tunefully, the furious blast
of the old cracked dinner-horn fell on the anxious ears in that
ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; It seemed clearer and more musical than a
chime of silver bells.</p>
<p>In a trice the wandering couples had gathered jubilantly round
the camp-fire, all embracing Bell, who was the heroine of the
hour&mdash;entirely by chance, and not though superior vision or
courage, as she confessed.</p>
<p>It was hardly fifteen minutes when Geoff strode into the ring
with his sorry-looking burden, which he laid immediately in Aunt
Truth&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh my darling!&rsquo; she cried, embracing him
fondly.&nbsp; &lsquo;To think you are really not dead, after
all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he is about as alive as any chap I ever
saw.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while the happy parents caressed their
restored darling, Geoff gathered the girls and boys around the
dinner-table, and repeated some of Dicky&rsquo;s remarks on the
homeward trip.</p>
<p>It seems that he considered himself the injured party, and
with great ingenuity laid all the blame of the mishap on his
elders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobuddy takes care of me, anyhow,&rsquo; he
grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;If my papa wasn&rsquo;t a mean fing
I&rsquo;d orter to have a black nurse with a white cap and apurn,
like Billy Thomas, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then I couldn&rsquo;t git
losted so offul easy.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you all never cared a cent
about it either, or you&rsquo;d a founded me quicker &rsquo;n
this&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been hungry fur nineteen
hours, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I guess I&rsquo;ve been gone till
December, by the feelin&rsquo;, but you was too lazy to found me
&rsquo;f I freezed to def&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t
but one singul boy of me round the whole camp, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
&rsquo;t would serveded you right if I had got losted for ever;
then I bet you wouldn&rsquo;t had much fun Fourth of July
&rsquo;thout my two bits &rsquo;n&rsquo; my
fire-crackers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was an hour or two before peace and quiet were restored to
the camp.&nbsp; The long-delayed dinner had to be eaten; and to
Hop Yet&rsquo;s calm delight, it was a very bad one.&nbsp;
Dicky&rsquo;s small wounds were dressed with sweet oil, and after
being fed and bathed he was tucked lovingly into bed, with a
hundred kisses or more from the whole party.</p>
<p>A little rest and attention had entirely restored his
good-humour; and when Dr. Paul went into the tent to see that all
was safe for the night, he found him sitting up in bed with a
gleeful countenance, prattling like a little angel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had an offul funny time &rsquo;bout my gittin&rsquo;
losted, didn&rsquo;t we, mamma?&rsquo; chuckled he, with his
gurgling little laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Next time I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to get losted in annover bran&rsquo;-new place where
no-bud-dy can find me!&nbsp; I fink it was the nicest time
&rsquo;cept Fourth of July, don&rsquo;t you, mamma?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he patted his mother&rsquo;s cheek and imprinted an oily kiss
thereon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truth,&rsquo; said the Doctor, with mild severity,
&lsquo;I know you don&rsquo;t believe in applying the slipper,
but I do think we should arrange some plan for giving that child
an idea of the solemnity of life.&nbsp; So far as I can judge, he
looks at it as one prolonged picnic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sentiments exactly!&rsquo; cried Bell,
energetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand many more of
these trying scenes; I am worn to a
&ldquo;shadder.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dicky tucked his head under his mother&rsquo;s arm, with a
sigh of relief that there was one person, at least, whose
sentiments were always favourable and always to be relied
upon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love you the best of anybuddy, mamma,&rsquo;
whispered he, and fell asleep.</p>

surface a few trifling freckles, which serve but to call

class="citation">[100g]</a></p>
<p>I have given that style a fair trial, my dear darling, but I
cannot stand it another minute, not being familiar with the
language of what our cook used to call the &lsquo;fuddal
aristocracy&rsquo; (feudal, you know).</p>
<p>I, your faithful Polly, am seated in the card-room, writing
with a dreadful pen which Phil gave me yesterday.&nbsp; Its
internal organs are filled with ink, which it disgorges when
<i>pressed</i> to do so, but just now it is &lsquo;too full for
utterance,&rsquo; as you will see by the blots.</p>
<p>We have decided not to make this a real round-robin letter,
like the last, because we want to write what we like, and not
have it read by the person who comes next.</p>
<p>I have been badgered to death over my part of the
communication sent to you last week, for the young persons
connected with this camp have a faculty of making mountains out
of mole-hills, as you know, and I have to suffer for every
careless little speech.&nbsp; However, as we didn&rsquo;t wish to
bore you with six duplicate letters, we invented a plan for
keeping off each other&rsquo;s ground, and appointed Geoff a
committee of one to settle our line of march.&nbsp; It is to be a
collective letter, made up of individual notes; and these are
Geoff&rsquo;s sealed orders, which must be obeyed, on pain of
dismissal from the camp:</p>
<blockquote><p>No. 1 (Polly) is to amuse!</p>
<p>No. 2 (Phil)&nbsp; . . . inform.</p>
<p>No. 3 (Geoff) . . . edify!!</p>
<p>No. 4 (Madge) . . . gossip.</p>
<p>No. 5 (Bell)&nbsp; . . . versify.</p>
<p>No. 6 (Jack)&nbsp; . . . illustrate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, my dear, if you get any &lsquo;information&rsquo; or
happen to be &lsquo;edified&rsquo; by what I write, don&rsquo;t
mention it for worlds!&nbsp; (I just screamed my fears about this
matter to Jack, and he says &lsquo;I needn&rsquo;t
fret.&rsquo;&nbsp; I shall certainly slap that boy before the
summer is over.)</p>
<p>I could just tell you a lovely story about Dicky&rsquo;s
getting lost in the woods the day before yesterday, and our
terrible fright about him, and how we all joined in the boy-hunt,
until Geoff and Bell found him at the Lone Stump; but I suppose
the chronicle belongs to Phil&rsquo;s province, so I
desist.&nbsp; But what can I say?&nbsp; Suppose I tell you that
Uncle Doc and the boys have been shooting innocent, <i>tame</i>
sheep, skinning and cutting them up on the way home, and making
us believe for two days that we were eating venison; and we never
should have discovered the imposition had not Dicky dragged home
four sheep-skins from the upper pool, and told us that he saw the
boys &lsquo;<i>peeling them off a venison</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps Phil may call this information, and Margery will vow that
it is gossip and belongs to her; any way, they consider it a
splendid joke, and chuckle themselves to sleep over it every
night; but I think the whole affair is perfectly maddening, and
it makes me boil with rage to be taken in so easily.&nbsp; Such a
to-do as they make over the matter you never saw; you would think
it was the first successful joke since the Deluge.&nbsp; (That
wasn&rsquo;t a <i>dry</i> joke, was it?&nbsp; Ha, ha!)</p>
<p>This is the way they twang on their harp of a thousand
strings.&nbsp; At breakfast, this morning, when Jack passed me
the corn-bread, I said innocently, &lsquo;Why, what have we
here?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is manna that fell in the
night,&rsquo; answered Jack, with an exasperating snicker.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t know mutton, but I thought, being a
Sunday-school teacher, you would know something about
manna.&rsquo;&nbsp; (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;He alludes to that time I
took the infant class for Miss Jones, and they all ran out to see
a military funeral procession.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you knew
something about manners,&rsquo; snapped I; and then Aunt Truth
had to warn us both, as usual.&nbsp; Oh dear! it&rsquo;s a weary
world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d just like to get Jack at a disadvantage
once!</p>
<p>We climbed Pico Negro yesterday.&nbsp; Bell, Geoff, Phil, and
I had quite an experience in losing the trail.&nbsp; I will tell
you about it.&nbsp; Just as&mdash;</p>
<p>(Goodness me! what have I written?&nbsp; Oh, Elsie, pray
excuse those <i>horizontal evidences</i> of my forgetfulness and
disobedience.&nbsp; I have bumped my head against the table three
times, as penance, and will now try to turn my thoughts into
right channels.&nbsp; This letter is a black-and-white evidence
that <i>I</i> have not a frivolous order of mind, and have always
been misunderstood from my birth up to this date.)</p>
<p>We have had beautiful weather since&mdash;but no, of course
Phil will tell you about the weather, for that is scarcely an
amusing topic.&nbsp; I do want to be as prudent as possible, for
Uncle Doc is going to read all the letters (not, of course,
aloud) and see whether we have fulfilled our specific
obligations.</p>
<p>(I just asked Bell whether &lsquo;specific&rsquo; had a
&lsquo;c&rsquo; or an&rsquo;s in the middle, and she answered
&lsquo;&ldquo;c,&rdquo; of course,&rsquo; with such an air, you
should have heard her!&nbsp; I had to remind her of the time she
spelled &lsquo;Tophet&rsquo; with an &lsquo;f&rsquo; in the
middle; then she subsided.)</p>
<p>(I just read this last paragraph to Madge, to see if she
called it gossip, as I was going to take it out if it belonged to
her topic, but she said No, she didn&rsquo;t call it gossip at
all&mdash;that she should call it slander!)</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how we all long to see you, dear darling
that you are.&nbsp; We live in the hope of having you with us
very soon, and meanwhile the beautiful bedstead is almost
finished, and a perfect success.&nbsp; (I wish to withdraw the
last three quarters of that sentence, for obvious reasons!!)</p>
<p>Dear, dear!&nbsp; Geoffrey calls &lsquo;Time up,&rsquo; and
I&rsquo;ve scarcely said anything I should.&nbsp; Never, never
again will I submit to this method of correspondence; it is
absolutely petrifying to one&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; When I am once
forced to walk in a path, nothing but the whole out-of-doors will
satisfy me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much afraid I haven&rsquo;t amused you,
dear,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But when I lie in the green kirkyard,<br />
With the mould upon my breast,<br />
Say not that &lsquo;She did well or ill,&rsquo;<br />
Only, &lsquo;She did her best.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, do you think that will interfere with Bell, when
it&rsquo;s only a quotation?&nbsp; Any way, it&rsquo;s so
appropriate that Uncle Doc will never have the heart to strike it
out.&nbsp; The trouble is that Geoff thinks all the poetry in the
universe is locked up in Bell&rsquo;s head, and if she once
allows it to escape, Felicia Hemans and the rest will be too
discouraged ever to try again!&nbsp; (I can&rsquo;t remember
whether F. H. is alive or not, and am afraid to ask, but you will
know that I don&rsquo;t mean to be disrespectful.)</p>
<p>Laura, Anne, and Scott Burton were here for the play, and
Laura is coming down again to spend the week.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
abide her, and there will probably be trouble in the camp.</p>
<p>The flame of my genius blazes high just now, but Geoff has
spoken, and it must be snuffed.&nbsp; So good-bye!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Sizz-z-z</i>!! and I&rsquo;m

<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">From Philip to
Elsie</span>.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Camp
Chaparral</span>, <i>July</i> 8, 188&ndash;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Elsie</span>,&mdash;I believe I am
to inform you concerning the daily doings of our party, not on
any account, however, permitting myself to degenerate into
&lsquo;gossip&rsquo; or &lsquo;frivolous amusement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They evidently consider me a quiet, stupid fellow, who will
fulfil such a task with no special feeling of repression, and I
dare say they are quite right.</p>
<p>They call me the &lsquo;solid man&rsquo; of the camp, which
may not be very high praise, to be sure, as Geoffrey carries his
head in the clouds, and Jack is&mdash;well, Jack is Jack!&nbsp;
So, as the light of a tallow dip is valuable in the absence of
sun and moon, I am raised to a fictitious reputation.</p>
<p>We fellows have had very little play so far, for the
furnishing of the camp has proved an immense undertaking,
although we have plenty of the right sort of wood and excellent
tools.</p>
<p>We think the work will pay, however, as Dr. Paul has about
decided to stay until October, or until the first rain.&nbsp; He
writes two or three hours a day, and thinks that he gets on with
his book better here than at home.&nbsp; As for the rest of us,
when we get fairly to rights we shall have regular study hours
and lose no time in preparing for the examinations.</p>
<p>I suppose you know that you have a full bedroom set in process
of construction.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;suppose you know,&rsquo;
because it is a profound secret, and the girls could never have
kept it to themselves as long as this.</p>
<p>The lounging-chair is my allotted portion, and although it is
a complicated bit of work, I accepted it gladly, feeling sure
that you would use it oftener than any of the other pieces of
furniture.&nbsp; I shall make it so deliciously easy that you
will make me &lsquo;Knight of the Chair,&rsquo; and perhaps
permit me to play a sort of devoted John Brown to your
Victoria.&nbsp; You will need one dull and prosy squire to
arrange your pillows, so that you can laugh at Jack&rsquo;s jokes
without weariness, and doze quietly while Geoff and Uncle Doc are
talking medicine.</p>
<p>Of course the most exciting event of the week was the
mysterious disappearance and subsequent restoration of the
Heir-Apparent; but I feel sure somebody else will describe the
event, because it is uppermost in all our minds.</p>
<p>Bell, for instance, would dress it up in fine style.&nbsp; She
is no historian, but in poetry and fiction none of us can touch
her; though, by the way, Polly&rsquo;s abilities in that
direction are a good deal underrated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as good as
a play to get her after Jack when he is in one of his teasing
moods.&nbsp; They are like flint and steel, and if Aunt Truth
didn&rsquo;t separate them the sparks would fly.&nbsp; With a
girl like Polly, you have either to lie awake nights, thinking
how you&rsquo;ll get the better of her, or else put on a
demeanour of gentleness and patience, which serves as a sort of
lightning-rod round which the fire of her fun will play all day
and never strike.&nbsp; Polly is a good deal of a girl.&nbsp; She
seems at first to have a pretty sharp tongue, but I tell you she
has a heart in which there is swimming-room for everybody.&nbsp;
This may not be &lsquo;information&rsquo; to you, whom we look
upon as our clairvoyant, but it would be news to most people.</p>
<p>Uncle Doc, Bell, Geoff, Polly, Meg, and I started for the top
of Pico Negro the other morning.&nbsp; Bell rode Villikins, and
Polly took a mule, because she thought the animal would be
especially sure-footed.&nbsp; He was; in fact, he was so
sure-footed that he didn&rsquo;t care to move at all, and we had
to take turns in beating him up to the top.&nbsp; We boys walked
for exercise, which we got to our hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>It is only five or six miles from the old Mountain Mill (a
picture of which Jack will send you), and the ascent is pretty
stiff climbing, though nothing terrific.&nbsp; We lost the trail
once, and floundered about in the chaparral for half an hour,
till Bell began to make a poem on the occasion, when we became
desperate, and dashed through a thicket of brush, tearing
ourselves to bits, but stumbling on the trail at last.&nbsp; The
view from the top is simply superb.&nbsp; The valleys below are
all yellow with grain-fields and green with vineyards, with here
and there the roofs of a straggling little settlement.&nbsp; The
depression in the side of the mountain (you will observe it in
the picture) Polly says has evidently been &lsquo;bitten
out&rsquo; by a prehistoric animal, and it turns out to be the
loveliest little ca&ntilde;on imaginable.</p>
<p>We have had one novel experience&mdash;that of seeing a
tarantula fight; and not between two, but five, tarantulas.&nbsp;
We were about twenty miles from camp, loping along a stretch of
hot, dusty road.&nbsp; Jack got off to cinch his saddle, and so
we all stopped a moment to let our horses breathe.&nbsp; As I was
looking about, at nothing in particular, I noticed a black ball
in the deep dust at the side of the road.&nbsp; It suddenly
rolled over on itself and I called to the boys to watch the
fun.&nbsp; We got off, hitched our horses, and approached
cautiously, for I had seen a battle of the same kind
before.&nbsp; There they were&mdash;five huge, hairy, dirty,
black creatures, as large as the palm of Dicky&rsquo;s hand, all
locked in deadly combat.&nbsp; They writhed and struggled and
embraced, their long, curling legs fastening on each other with a
sound that was actually like the cracking of bones.&nbsp; It
takes a little courage to stand and watch such a proceeding, for
you feel as if the hideous fellows might turn and jump for you;
but they were doubtless absorbed in their own battle, and we
wanted to see the affair to the end, so we took the risk, if
there was any.&nbsp; At last they showed signs of weariness, but
we prodded them up with our riding-whips, preferring that they
should kill each other, rather than do the thing ourselves.&nbsp;
Finally, four of them lay in the dust, doubled up and harmless,
slain, I suppose, by their own poison.&nbsp; One, the conquering
hero, remained, and we dexterously scooped him into a tomato-can
that Jack had tied to his saddle for a drinking-cup, covered him
up with a handkerchief, and drew lots as to who should carry him
home to Dr. Paul.</p>
<p>Knowing that the little beasts were gregarious, we hunted
about for a nest, which we might send to you after ousting its
disagreeable occupant.&nbsp; After much searching, we found a
group of them&mdash;quite a tarantula village, in fact.&nbsp;
Their wonderful little houses are closed on the outside by a
circular, many-webbed mesh, two or three inches across, and this
web betrays the spider&rsquo;s den to the person who knows the
tricks of the trade.&nbsp; Directly underneath it you come upon
the tiny circular trap-door, which you will notice in the nest we
send with these letters.&nbsp; You will see how wonderfully it is
made, with its silken weaving inside, and its bits of bark and
leaves outside; and I know you will admire the hinge, which the
tarantula must have invented, and which is as pretty a bit of
workmanship as the most accomplished mechanic could turn
out.&nbsp; We tore away the web and the door from one of the
nests, and then poured water down the hole.&nbsp; The spider was
at home, came out as fact as his clumsy legs would carry him, and
clutched the end of the stick Jack held out to him.&nbsp; Then we
tumbled him into the tomato-can just as he appeared to be making
for us.&nbsp; The two didn&rsquo;t agree at all.&nbsp; One of
them despatched the other on the way home&mdash;the same hero who
had killed the other four; but, on hearing his bloody record,
Aunt Truth refused to have him about the camp; so we gave him an
alcohol bath, and you shall see his lordship when you come.&nbsp;
As Dr. Paul says, they have been known to clear fourteen feet at
a jump, perhaps you will feel happier to know that he is in
alcohol, though their bite is not necessarily fatal if it is
rightly cared for.</p>
<p>The girls have been patronising the landscape by naming every
peak, valley, grove, and stream in the vicinity; and as there is
nobody to object, the names may hold.</p>
<p>We carry about with us a collection of strong, flat stakes,
which have various names painted on them in neat black
letters.&nbsp; Jack likes that kind of work, and spends most of
his time at it; for now that Dr. Paul has bought a hundred acres
up here, we are all greatly interested in its improvement.</p>
<p>Geoff has named the mountain Pico Negro, as I told you, and
the little ca&ntilde;on on its side is called the Giant&rsquo;s
Yawn.&nbsp; Then we have&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Mirror Pool,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Lone Stump,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Field of the Cloth-of-Gold,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Cosy Nook,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Imp&rsquo;s Wash-Bowl,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Dunce-Cap Hill,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Saint&rsquo;s Rest, and</p>
<p class="gutindent">Il Penseroso Fall (in honour of Dicky, who
was nearly drowned there).</p>
<p>If anybody fails to call these localities by their proper
names he has to pay a fine of five cents, which goes towards
beautifying the place.&nbsp; Dr. Paul has had to pay two fines
for Bell, three for Aunt Truth, and seven for Dicky; so he
considers it an ill-judged arrangement.</p>
<p>Our encampment is supposed to be in the Forest of Arden, and
Jack has begun nailing verses of poetry on the trees, like a
second Orlando, save that they are not love-poems at all, but
appropriate quotations from Wordsworth or Bryant.&nbsp; And this
brings me to our thrilling rendition of the play &lsquo;As You
Like It,&rsquo; last evening; but it is deserving of more than
the passing notice which I can give it here.</p>
<p>One thing, however, I must tell you, as the girls will not
write it of themselves&mdash;that, although Bell carried off
first honours and fairly captivated the actors as well as the
audience, all three of them looked bewitching and acted with the
greatest spirit, much better than we fellows did.</p>
<p>Of course we didn&rsquo;t give the entire play, and we had to
&lsquo;double up&rsquo; on some of the characters in the most
ridiculous fashion; but the Burtons helped out wonderfully, Scott
playing Oliver, and Laura doing Audrey.&nbsp; They were so
delighted with the camp that Aunt Truth has invited them to come
again on Saturday and stay a week.</p>
<p>At the risk of being called conceited I will also state that
we boys consider that the stage management was a triumph of
inventive art; we worked like beavers for two days, and the
results were marvellous, &lsquo;if I do say so as
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just consider we were &lsquo;six miles from a lemon,&rsquo; as
Sydney Smith would say, and yet we transformed all out of doors,
first into an elegant interior, and then into a conventional
stage forest.</p>
<p>A great deal of work is available for other performances, and
so we do not regret it a bit; we propose doing &lsquo;As You Like
It&rsquo; again when you are down here, and meanwhile we give
diversified entertainments which Jack calls variety shows, but
which in reality are very chaste and elegant occasions.</p>
<p>The other night we had a minstrel show, wearing masks of black
cambric, with red mouths painted on them; you should have seen
us, all in a dusky semicircle, seated on boards supported by
nail-kegs: it was a scene better imagined than described.&nbsp;
This is certainly the ideal way to live in summer-time, and we
should be perfectly happy and content if you could only shake off
your troublesome cough and come to share our pleasure.&nbsp; We
feel incomplete without you; and no matter how large our party
may grow as the summer progresses, there will always be a vacant
niche that none can fill save the dear little Saint who is always
enshrined therein by all her loyal worshippers, and by none more
reverently than her friend,</p>

<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Knight of the Spectacles

<p>This paper is writ unto her most Royal Highness, our beloved
Gold Elsie, Queen of our thoughts and Empress of all hearts.</p>
<p>You must know, most noble Lady, that one who is your next of
kin and high in the royal favour has laid upon us a most
difficult and embarrassing task.</p>
<p>In our capacity as Director of the Court Games, we humbly
suggested the subjects for the weekly bulletin which your
Highness commanded to be written; but, alas, with indifferent
success; for the Courtiers growled and the Ladies-in-waiting
howled at the topics given them for consideration.</p>
<p>On soliciting our own subjects from the Privy Councillor and
Knight of the Brush, Lord John Howard, he revengefully ordered me
to &lsquo;edify&rsquo; your Majesty with wise utterances; as if
such poor, rude words as mine could please the ear that should
only listen to the singing of birds, the babbling of brooks, or
the silvery tongue of genius!</p>
<p>When may your devoted subjects hope to see their gracious
Sovereign again in their midst?</p>
<p>The court is fast drifting into dangerous informalities of
conduct.&nbsp; The Princess Bell-Pepper partakes of the
odoriferous onion at each noon-day meal, so that a royal salute
would be impossible; the hands of the Countess Paulina look as if
you might have chosen one of your attendants from
&lsquo;Afric&rsquo;s sunny fountains, or India&rsquo;s coral
strand&rsquo;; and as for the Court Chaplain, Rev.
Jack-in-the-Pulpit, he has woefully forsaken the manners of the
&lsquo;cloth,&rsquo; and insists upon retaining his ancient title
of Knight of the Brush; the Duchess of Sweet Marjoram alone
continues circumspect in walk and mien, for blood will tell, and
she is more Noble than the others.</p>
<p>In our capacity of Court Physician we have thrice relieved
your youthful page, Sir Dicky Winship, of indigestion, caused by
too generous indulgence in the flowing bowl&mdash;of milk and
cherries; we have also prescribed for his grace the Duke of
Noble, whose ducal ear was poisoned by the insidious oak
leaf.</p>
<p>Your private box awaits you in the Princess&rsquo; Theatre,
and your Majesty&rsquo;s special interpreters of the drama will
celebrate your arrival as gorgeously as it deserves.</p>
<p>The health of our dearly beloved Sovereign engages the
constant thought of all her loyal and adoring subjects; they hope
ere long to cull a wreath of laurel with their own hands and
place it on a brow which needs naught but its golden crown of
hair to affirm its queenly dignity.&nbsp; And as for crown
jewels, has not our Empress of Hearts a full store?&mdash;two
dazzling sapphires, her eyes; a string of pearls, her teeth; her
lips two rubies; and when she opens them, diamonds of wisdom
issue therefrom!</p>
<p>Come! and let the sight of thy royal charms gladden the eyes
of thy waiting people!&nbsp; Issued under the hand of</p>

has refused to read this part of the letter.</p>
<p>First for some commissions: Aunt Truth asks if your mother
will kindly select goods and engage Mrs. Perkins to make us each
a couple of Scotch gingham dresses.&nbsp; She has our measures,
and we wish them simple, full-skirted gowns, like the last;
everybody thinks them so pretty and becoming.&nbsp; Bell&rsquo;s
two must be buff and pink, Polly&rsquo;s grey and green, and mine
blue and brown.&nbsp; We find that we haven&rsquo;t clothes
enough for a three months&rsquo; stay; and the out-of-door life
is so hard upon our &lsquo;forest suits&rsquo; that we have asked
Mrs. Perkins to send us new ones as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We have had a very busy and exciting week since Polly began
this letter, for there have been various interruptions and an
unusual number of visitors.</p>
<p>First, there was our mountain climb to the top of Pico Negro;
Phil says he has written you about that, but I hardly believe he
mentioned that he and the other boys worried us sadly by hanging
on to the tails of our horses as they climbed up the steepest
places.&nbsp; To be sure they were so awfully tired that I
couldn&rsquo;t help pitying them; but Uncle Doc had tried to
persuade them not to walk, so that it was their own fault after
all.&nbsp; You cannot imagine what a dreadful feeling it gives
one to be climbing a slippery, rocky path, and know that a great
heavy boy is pulling your horse backwards by the tail.&nbsp;
Polly insisted that she heard her mule&rsquo;s tail break loose
from its moorings, and on measuring it when she got back to camp
she found it three inches longer than usual.</p>
<p>The mule acted like original sin all day, and Polly was so
completely worn-out that she went to bed at five o&rsquo;clock;
Jack was a good deal the worse for wear too, so that they got on
beautifully all day.&nbsp; It is queer that they irritate each
other so, for I am sure that there is no lack of real friendship
between them; but Jack is a confirmed tease, and he seems to keep
all his mischief bottled up for especial use with Polly.&nbsp; I
have tried to keep him out of trouble, as you asked me; and
although it gives me plenty to do, I am succeeding tolerably
well, except in his dealings with Polly.&nbsp; I lecture him
continually, but &lsquo;every time he opens his mouth he puts his
foot in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly was under a cloud the first of the week.&nbsp; Villikins
was sick, and Dr. Winship sent her to Aunt Truth for a bottle of
sweet oil.&nbsp; Aunt Truth was not in sight, so Polly went to
the box of stores and emptied a whole quart bottle of salad oil
into a pail, and Villikins had to take it, <i>wheel or whoa</i>
(Jack&rsquo;s joke!).&nbsp; Auntie went to make the salad
dressing at dinner-time, and discovered her loss and
Polly&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; It was the last bottle; and as we
can&rsquo;t get any more for a week, the situation was serious,
and she was very much tried.&nbsp; Poor Polly had a good cry over
her carelessness, and came to the dinner-table in a very
sensitive frame of mind.&nbsp; Then what should Jack do but tell
Dicky to take Villikins a head of lettuce for his supper, and ask
Polly why she didn&rsquo;t change his name from Villikins to
Salad-in!&nbsp; Polly burst into tears, and left the table, while
Dr. Paul gave Jack a scolding, which I really think he deserved,
though it was a good joke.&nbsp; The next morning, the young
gentleman put on a pair of old white cotton gloves and his best
hat, gathered her a bouquet of wild flowers, and made her a
handsome apology before the whole party; so she forgave him, and
they are friends&mdash;until the next quarrel.</p>
<p>On the night before the play, Laura and Scott Burton arrived
on horseback, and the next morning the rest of the family
appeared on the scene.&nbsp; We had sent over to see if Laura
would play Audrey on so short notice, and bring over some odds
and ends for costumes.&nbsp; We actually had an audience of
sixteen persons, and we had no idea of playing before anybody but
Aunt Truth and Dicky.</p>
<p>There were three of the Burtons, Pancho, Hop Yet, the people
from the dairy farm, and a university professor from Berkeley,
with eight students.&nbsp; They were on a walking tour, and were
just camping for the night when Scott and Jack met them, and
invited them over to the performance.&nbsp; Geoffrey and Phil
were acquainted with three of them, and Uncle Paul knew the
professor.</p>
<p>Laura, Anne, and Scott went home the next morning, but came
back in two days for their week&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; The boys
like Scott very much; he falls right into the camp ways, and
doesn&rsquo;t disturb the even current of our life; and Anne, who
is a sweet little girl of twelve, has quite taken Dicky under her
wing, much to our relief.</p>
<p>With Laura&rsquo;s advent, however, a change came over the
spirit of our dreams, and, to tell the truth, we are not over and
above pleased with it.&nbsp; By the way, she spent last summer at
the hotel, and you must have seen her, did you not?&nbsp; Anyway,
Mrs. Burton and Aunt Truth were old school friends, and Bell has
known Laura for two years, but they will never follow in their
mothers&rsquo; footsteps.&nbsp; Laura is so different from her
mother that I should never think they were relations; and she has
managed to change all our arrangements in some mysterious way
which we can&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; I get on very well with
her; she positively showers favours upon me, and I more than half
suspect it is because she thinks I don&rsquo;t amount to
much.&nbsp; As for the others, she rubs Polly the wrong way, and
I believe she is a little bit jealous of Bell.</p>
<p>You see, she is several months older than the rest of us, and
has spent two winters in San Francisco, where she went out a
great deal to parties and theatres, so that her ideas are
entirely different from ours.</p>
<p>She wants every single bit of attention&mdash;one boy to help
her over the brooks, one to cut walking-sticks for her, another
to peel her oranges, and another to read Spanish with her, and so
on.&nbsp; Now, you know very well that she will never get all
this so long as Bell Winship is in camp, for the boys think that
Bell drags up the sun when she&rsquo;s ready for him in the
morning, and pushes him down at night when she happens to feel
sleepy.</p>
<p>We, who have known Bell always, cannot realise that any one
can help loving her, but there is something in Laura which makes
it impossible for her to see the right side of people.&nbsp; She
told me this morning that she thought Bell had grown so vain and
airy and self-conscious that it was painful to see her.&nbsp; I
could not help being hurt; for you know what Bell
is&mdash;brimful of nonsense and sparkle and bright speeches, but
just as open as the day and as warm as the sunshine.&nbsp; If she
could have been spoiled, we should have turned her head long ago;
but she hasn&rsquo;t a bit of silly vanity, and I never met any
one before who didn&rsquo;t see the pretty charm of her
brightness and goodness&mdash;did you?</p>
<p>And yet, somehow, Laura sticks needles into her every time she
speaks.&nbsp; She feels them, too, but it only makes her quiet,
for she is too proud and sensitive to resent it.&nbsp; I can see
that she is different in her ways, as if she felt she was being
criticised.&nbsp; Polly is quite the reverse.&nbsp; If anybody
hurts her feelings she makes creation scream, and I admire her
courage.</p>
<p>Aunt Truth doesn&rsquo;t know anything about all this, for
Laura is a different girl when she is with her or Dr. Paul; not
that she is deceitful, but that she is honestly anxious for their
good opinion.&nbsp; You remember Aunt Truth&rsquo;s hobby that we
should never defend ourselves by attacking any one else, and none
of us would ever complain, if we were hung, drawn, and
quartered.</p>
<p>Laura was miffed at having to play Audrey, but we didn&rsquo;t
know that she could come until the last moment, and we were going
to leave that part out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you appreciate my generosity in
taking this thankless part,&rsquo; she said to Bell, when we were
rehearsing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody would ever catch you playing
second fiddle, my dear.&nbsp; All leading parts reserved for Miss
Winship, by order of the authors, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Laura,&rsquo; Bell said, &lsquo;if we had known
you were coming we would have offered you the best part, but I
only took Rosalind because I knew the lines, and the girls
insisted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve trained the girls well&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
she, Geoffrey?&rsquo; asked Laura, with a queer kind of
laugh.</p>
<p>But I will leave the unpleasant subject.&nbsp; I should not
have spoken of it at all except that she has made me so
uncomfortable to-day that it is fresh in my mind.&nbsp; Bell and
Polly and I have talked the matter all over, and are going to try
and make her like us, whether she wants to or not.&nbsp; We have
agreed to be just as polite and generous as we possibly can, and
see if she won&rsquo;t &lsquo;come round,&rsquo; for she is
perfectly delighted with the camp, and wants to stay a month.</p>
<p>Polly says she is going to sing &lsquo;Home Sweet Home&rsquo;
to her every night, and drop double doses of the homoeopathic
cure for home-sickness into her tea, with a view of creating the
disease.</p>
<p>Good-bye, and a hundred kisses from your loving</p>

<h3>V.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Camp Poetess adds her Store
of Mental Riches to the General Fund</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">My darling</span>,&mdash;I have a thousand
things to tell you, but I cannot possibly say them in rhyme,
merely because the committee insists upon it.&nbsp; I send you
herewith all the poetry which has been written in camp since last
Monday, and it has been a very prosy week.</p>
<p>I have given them to papa, and he says that the best of my
own, which are all bad enough, is the following hammock-song.</p>
<p>I thought it out while I was swinging Margery, and here it
is!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To&mdash;fro,<br />
Dreamily, slow,<br />
Under the trees;<br />
Swing&mdash;swing,<br />
Drowsily sing<br />
The birds and the bees;<br />
Sleep&mdash;rest,<br />
Slumber is best,<br />
Wakefulness sad;<br />
Rest&mdash;sleep,<br />
Forget how to weep,<br />
Dream and be glad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Papa says it is all nonsense to say that slumber is best and
wakefulness sad; and that it is possible to tell the truth in
poetry.&nbsp; Perhaps it is, but why don&rsquo;t they do it
oftener, then?&nbsp; And how was he to know that Polly and Jack
had just gone through a terrible battle of words in which I was
peacemaker, and that Dicky had been as naughty
as&mdash;Nero&mdash;all day?&nbsp; These two circumstances made
me look at the world through blue glasses, and that is always the
time one longs to write poetry.</p>
<p>I send you also Geoff&rsquo;s verses, written to mamma, and
slipped into the box when we were playing Machine
Poetry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I know a woman fair and calm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose shining tender eyes<br />
Make, when I meet their earnest gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet thoughts within me rise.</p>
<p>And if all silver were her hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or faded were her face,<br />
She would not look to me less fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor lack a single grace.</p>
<p>And if I were a little child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With childhood&rsquo;s timid trust,<br />
I think my heart would fly to her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love&mdash;because it must!</p>
<p>And if I were an earnest man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With empty heart and life,<br />
I think&mdash;(but I might change my mind)&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;d be my chosen wife!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that pretty?&nbsp; Oh, Elsie!&nbsp; I hope I shall
grow old as beautifully as mamma does, so that people can write
poetry to me if they feel like it!&nbsp; Here is Jack&rsquo;s,
for Polly&rsquo;s birthday; he says he got the idea from a real
poem which is just as silly as his:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A pollywog from a wayside brook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a goodly gift for thee;<br />
But a milk-white steed, or a venison sheep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will do very well for me.</p>
<p>For you a quivering asphodel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Two ducks and a good fat hen),<br />
For me a withering hollyhock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (For seven and three are ten!).</p>
<p>Rose-red locks and a pug for thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The falling dew is chill),<br />
A dove, a rope, and a rose for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oh, passionate, pale-blue pill!).</p>
<p>For you a greenery, yallery gown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hath one tomb room for four?),<br />
Dig me a narrow gravelet here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oh, red is the stain of gore!!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I told Jack I thought it extremely unhitched, but he says
that&rsquo;s the chief beauty of the imitation.</p>
<p>I give you also some verses intended for Polly&rsquo;s
birthday, which we shall celebrate, when the day arrives, by a
grand dinner.</p>
<p>You remember how we tease her about her love for tea, which
she cannot conceal, but which she is ashamed of all the same.</p>
<p>Well!&nbsp; I have printed the poem on a card, and on the
other side Margery has drawn the picture of a cross old maid,
surrounded by seven cats, all frying to get a drink out of her
tea-cup.&nbsp; Then Geoff is going to get a live cat from the
milk ranch near here, and box it up for me to give to her when
she receives her presents at the dinner-table.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
it be fun?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">OWED TO POLLY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BECAUSE OF HER BIRTHDAY.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>She camps among the untrodden ways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forninst the &lsquo;Mountain Mill&rsquo;;<br />
A maid whom there are few to praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And few to wish her ill.</p>
<p>She lives unknown, and few could know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What Pauline is to me;<br />
As dear a joy as are to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her frequent cups of tea.</p>
<p>A birthday this dear creature had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a year ago;<br />
She says she is but just fifteen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course she ought to know.</p>
<p>But still this gift I bring to her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate to her age,<br />
Regardless of her stifled scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or well conceal-ed rage!</p>
<p>She smiles upon these tender lines,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As you all plainly see,<br />
But when she meets me all alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How different it will be!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now comes Geoff&rsquo;s, to be given with a pretty little
inkstand:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a young maiden whose thought<br />
Was so airy it couldn&rsquo;t be caught;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So what do you think?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We gave her some ink,<br />
And captured her light-winged thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is Jack&rsquo;s last on Polly:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s a pert little poppet called
Polly,<br />
Who frequently falls into folly!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a terrible tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a &lsquo;creetur&rsquo; so young,<br />
But if she were dumb she&rsquo;d be jolly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I helped Polly with a reply, and we delivered it five minutes
later:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d rather be deaf, Master Jack,<br />
For if only one sense I must lack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be rid of your voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should always rejoice,<br />
Nor mourn if it never came back!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now good-night and good-bye until I am allowed to write
you my own particular kind of letter.</p>
<p>The girls and boys are singing round the camp-fire, and I must
go out and join them in one song before we go to bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours with love, now and always,<br

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Our &lsquo;Happy Hexagon&rsquo; has become a
sort of &lsquo;Obstreperous Octagon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Laura and Scott
Burton are staying with us.&nbsp; Scott is a good deal of a
bookworm, and uses very long words; his favourite name for me at
present is Calliope; I thought it was a sort of steam-whistle,
but Margery thinks it was some one who was connected with
poetry.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t dare ask the boys; will you find

</blockquote>
<p>The grand performance of &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo; must
have a more extended notice than it has yet received, inasmuch as
its double was never seen on any stage.</p>
<p>The reason of this somewhat ambitious selection lay in the
fact that our young people had studied it in Dr. Winship&rsquo;s
Shakespeare class the preceding winter, but they were actually
dumb with astonishment when Bell proposed it for the opening
performance in the new theatre.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; she argued, &lsquo;there are not
many pieces which would be effective when played out of doors by
dim candle-light, but this will be just as romantic and lovely as
can be.&nbsp; You see it can be played just &ldquo;as you like
it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Philip and Aunt Truth wanted a matin&eacute;e performance, but
the girls resisted this plan very strongly, feeling that the
garish light of day would be bad for the makeshift costumes, and
would be likely to rob them of what little courage they
possessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We give the decoration of the theatre entirely into
your hands, boys,&rsquo; Polly had said on the day before the
performance.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have some of the hardest work done
already, and can just devote yourselves to the ornamental part;
but don&rsquo;t expect any more ideas from us, for you will
certainly be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think not, indeed!&rsquo; cried Bell,
energetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here we have the wall decorations for
the first scene, and all the costumes besides; and the trouble
is, that three or four of them will have to be made to-morrow,
after Laura comes with the trappings of war.&nbsp; I hope she
will get here for dinner to-night; then we can decide on our
finery, and have a rough rehearsal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, girls!&rsquo; shouted Jack, from the theatre,
&lsquo;come and have one consultation, and then we&rsquo;ll let
you off.&nbsp; Phil wants to change the location
altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; cried Madge, as the three girls
ran towards the scene of action.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only
suitable place within a mile of the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it will be simply perfect, when you have done a
little more cutting,&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just see our
advantages: First, we have that rising knoll opposite the stage,
which is exactly the thing for audience seats; then we have a
semicircular background of trees and a flat place for the stage,
which is perfectly invaluable; last of all, just gaze upon that
madro&ntilde;o-tree in the centre, and the oak on the left; why,
they are worth a thousand dollars for scenery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Especially in the first scene&mdash;ducal interior, or
whatever it is,&rsquo; said Phil, disconsolately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jingo! that is a little embarrassing,&rsquo; groaned
Jack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Polly, briskly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is plenty of room to set the interior in front of
those trees.&nbsp; It can be all fixed beforehand, and just
whisked away for good at the end of the first act.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Geoff,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we can&rsquo;t have any
Adam&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; We talked it over last night, and
decided it &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be did.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Bell,
sarcastically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then allow me to remark that you
three boys represent a very obtuse triangle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, most acid Rosalind!&rsquo; murmured Geoff,
meekly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Could you deign, as spokesman of the very
acute triangle, to suggest something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; There is the rear of the brush kitchen
in plain sight, to convey the idea of a rustic hut.&nbsp; To be
sure, it&rsquo;s a good distance to the left, but let the
audience screw round in their seats when they hear the voices,
and Adam, Oliver, and Orlando can walk out carelessly, and go
through their scene right there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Admirable!&rsquo; quoth Geoff.&nbsp; &lsquo;We bow to
your superior judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an inspiration that was to bring those Chinese
lanterns for the Fourth of July; they have just saved us from
utter ruin,&rsquo; said Margery, who was quietly making
leaf-trimming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the effect is going to be perfectly
gorgeous!&rsquo; exclaimed Polly, clasping her hands in
anticipation.&nbsp; &lsquo;How many have we?&nbsp; Ten?&nbsp; Oh,
that&rsquo;s splendid; and how many candles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As many as we care to use,&rsquo; Phil answered, from
the top of the ladder where he was at work.&nbsp; &lsquo;And look
at my arrangement for holding them to these trees.&nbsp;
Aren&rsquo;t they immense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; said Bell, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t forget
the mossy banks under those trees, for stage seats; and make me
some kind of a thing on the left side, to swoon on when I sniff
Orlando&rsquo;s gory handkerchief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A couple of rocks,&rsquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; replied the critical Rosalind, with
great dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am black and blue already from
practising my faint, and I expect to shriek with pain when I fall
to-morrow night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Jacob&rsquo;s Oil relieves stiffened joints,
smooths the wrinkles from the brow of care, soothes lacerated
feelings, and &rsquo;ushes the &rsquo;owl of hinfancy,&rsquo;
remarked Geoffrey serenely, as he prepared to build the required
mossy banks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear cousin (there are times when I am glad it is
only second cousin), have you a secret contract to advertise a
vulgar patent medicine? or why this eloquence?&rsquo; laughed
Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Jack,&rsquo; suggested Polly, &lsquo;you
don&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything; fix a stump for me to sit
on while Orlando and Rosalind are making love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, countess.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see you
stumped once in my life.&nbsp; Shall we have the canvases brought
for stage carpets?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We say no,&rsquo; cried Rosalind, firmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We shall be a thousand times more awkward stumbling over
stiff billows of carpet.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s sweep the ground as
clean and smooth as possible, and let it go for all the
scenes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we shall then be well <i>grounded</i> in our
parts,&rsquo; remarked Phil, hiding his head behind a bunch of
candles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, young man,&rsquo; laughed Polly, &lsquo;or
you may be &ldquo;run to earth&rdquo; instead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or be requested by the audience to get up and
dust,&rsquo; cried the irrepressible Jack, whose wit was very apt
to be of a slangy character.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now let us settle the
interior, or I shall go mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bell and I have it all settled,&rsquo; said Geoffrey,
promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The background is to be made of three
sheets hung over a line, and the two sides will be formed of
canvas carpets; the walls will have Japanese fans, parasols,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jupiter!&rsquo; exclaimed Jack, who, as knight of the
brush, felt compelled to be artistic.&nbsp; &lsquo;Imagine a
ducal palace, in the year so many hundred and something,
decorated with Japanese bric-a-brac!&nbsp; I blush for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Jack, we might as well drop the whole play as
begin to think of the &lsquo;nakkeronisms,&rsquo; or whatever the
word is.&nbsp; I have got to wear an old white wrapper to the
wrestling-match, but I don&rsquo;t complain,&rsquo; said
Polly.</p>
<p>Just here Bell ran back from the kitchen, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have secured Pancho for Charles the Wrestler.&nbsp;
Oh, he was fearfully obstinate! but when I told him he would only
be on the stage two minutes, and would not have to speak a word,
but just let Geoff throw him, he consented.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
that good?&nbsp; Did you decide about the decorations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will have to be just as we suggested,&rsquo;
answered Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fans, parasols, flowers, and
leaves, with the madro&ntilde;o-wood furniture scattered about,
sheep-skins, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few venison rugs, I presume you mean,&rsquo; said
Geoffrey, slyly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say, Polly, omit the cold cream for
once, will you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to outshine
everybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will
endeavour to take care of my own complexion, if you will allow
me.&nbsp; As for yours, you look more like Othello than
Orlando.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, girls,&rsquo; said industrious Margery,
&lsquo;let us go to the tent and sew.&nbsp; It is nothing but
nonsense here, and we are not accomplishing anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they wisely left the boys to themselves for the entire day,
and transformed their tent into a mammoth dressmaking
establishment, with clever Aunt Truth as chief designer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The intervening hours had slipped quickly away, and now the
fatal moment had arrived, and everything was ready for the
play.</p>
<p>The would-be actresses were a trifle excited when the
Professor and his eight students were brought up and introduced
by Jack and Scott Burton; and, as if that were not enough, who
should drive up at the last moment but the family from the
neighbouring milk ranch, and beg to be allowed the pleasure of
witnessing the performance.&nbsp; Mr. Sandford was the gentleman
who had sold Dr. Winship his land, and so they were cordially
invited to remain.</p>
<p>All the cushions and shawls belonging to the camp were
arranged carefully on the knoll, for audience seats; it was a
brilliant moonlight night, and the stage assumed a very festive
appearance with its four pounds of candles and twelve Chinese
lanterns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the actors were dressing in their respective
tents.&nbsp; Bell&rsquo;s first dress was a long pink muslin
wrapper of Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s, which had been belted in and
artistically pasted over with bouquets from the cretonne trunk
covers, in imitation of flowered satin; under this she wore a
short blue lawn skirt of her own, catching up the pink muslin on
the left side with a bouquet of wild roses, and producing what
she called a &lsquo;positively Neilson effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her bright hair was tossed up into a fluffy knot on the top of
her head; and with a flat coronet of wild roses and another great
bunch at her belt, one might have gone far and not have found a
prettier Rosalind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare, you are just too lovely&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
she, Laura?&rsquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she looks quite well,&rsquo; answered Laura,
abstractedly, being much occupied in making herself absurdly
beautiful as Audrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course the dress fits
horridly, but perhaps it won&rsquo;t show in the dim
light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is it very bad?&rsquo; sighed Bell, plaintively;
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see it in this glass.&nbsp; Well, the next
one fits better, and I have to wear that the longest.&nbsp; Shall
I do your hair, Laura?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;thanks; Margery has such a capital knack at
hair-dressing, and she doesn&rsquo;t come on yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation Polly was struggling with Aunt
Truth&rsquo;s trained white wrapper.&nbsp; It was rather
difficult to make it look like a court dress; but she looked as
fresh and radiant as a rose in it, for the candle-light
obliterated every freckle, and one could see nothing but a pair
of dancing eyes, the pinkest of cheeks, and a head running over
with curls of ruddy gold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Bell, criticise me!&rsquo; she cried, taking a
position in the middle of the tent, and turning round like a wax
figure.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have torn out my hair by the roots to give
it a &ldquo;done up&rdquo; look, and have I succeeded? and shall
I wear any flowers with this lace surplice? and what on earth
shall I do with my hands? they&rsquo;re so black they will cast a
gloom over the stage.&nbsp; Perhaps I can wrap my handkerchief
carelessly round one, and I&rsquo;ll keep the other round your
waist, considerable, tucked under your Watteau pleat.&nbsp; Will
I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do?&nbsp; I should think so!&rsquo; and Bell eyed her
with manifest approval.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your hair is very nice, and
your neck looks lovely with that lace handkerchief.&nbsp; As for
flowers, why don&rsquo;t you wear a great mass of yellow and
white daisies?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be as gorgeous
as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a sunset by Turner,&rsquo; said Laura, with a glance
at Polly&rsquo;s auburn locks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seems to me this is a
mutual admiration society, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; and she sank
languidly into a chair to have her hair dressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; cried Polly, boldly; &lsquo;and
it&rsquo;s going to &ldquo;continner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meg,
you&rsquo;re a darling in that blue print and pretty hat.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll fill my fern-basket with flowers, and you can take it,
as to have something in your hand to play with.&nbsp; You look
nicer than any Ph&oelig;be I ever saw, that&rsquo;s a fact.&nbsp;
And now, hurrah! we&rsquo;re all ready, and there&rsquo;s the
boys&rsquo; bell, so let us assemble out in the kitchen.&nbsp; Oh
dear!&nbsp; I believe I&rsquo;m frightened, in spite of every
promise to the contrary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the young people saw each other for the first time in
their stage costumes there was a good deal of merriment and some
honest admiration.&nbsp; Geoff looked very odd without his
eyeglasses and with the yellow wig that was the one property
belonging to this star dramatic organisation.</p>
<p>The girls had not succeeded in producing a great effect with
the masculine costumes, because of insufficient material.&nbsp;
But the boys had determined not to wear their ordinary clothes,
no matter what happened; so Jack had donned one of Hop
Yet&rsquo;s blue blouses for his Sylvius dress, and had ready a
plaid shawl to throw gracefully over one shoulder whenever he
changed to the Banished Duke.</p>
<p>His Sylvius attire was open to criticism, but no one could
fail to admire his appearance as the Duke, on account of a
magnificent ducal head-gear, from which soared a bunch of tall
peacock feathers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Jack, what a head-dress for a Duke!&rsquo; laughed
Margery; &lsquo;no wonder they banished you.&nbsp; Did you offend
the court hatter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phil said that at all events nobody could mistake him for
anything but a fool, in his &lsquo;Touchstone&rsquo; costume, and
so he was jest-er going to be contented.</p>
<p>Scott Burton was arranging Pancho&rsquo;s toilette for the
wrestling-match, and meanwhile trying to raise his drooping
spirits; and Rosalind was vainly endeavouring to make
Adam&rsquo;s beard of grey moss stay on.</p>
<p>While these antics were going on behind the scenes, the
audience was seated on the knoll, making merry over the written
programmes, which had been a surprise of Geoff&rsquo;s, and read
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The scene between Adam and Orlando went off with good effect;
and when Celia and Rosalind came through the trees in an
affectionate attitude, and Celia&rsquo;s blithe voice broke the
stillness with, &lsquo;I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be
merry,&rsquo; there was a hearty burst of applause which almost
frightened them into silence.</p>
<p>At the end of the first act everybody was delighted; the
stage-manager, carpenter, scene-shifter, costumier, and all the
stars were called successively before the curtain.</p>
<p>Hop Yet declared it was &lsquo;all the same good as China
theatre&rsquo;; and every one agreed to that criticism without a
dissenting voice.</p>
<p>To be sure, there was an utter absence of stage-management,
and all the &lsquo;traditions&rsquo; were remarkable for their
absence; but I fancy that the spirits of Siddons and Kemble,
Macready and Garrick, looked down with kind approval upon these
earnest young actors as they recited the matchless old words,
moving to and fro in the quaint setting of trees and moonlight,
with an orchestra of cooing doves and murmuring zephyrs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p133b.jpg">
<img alt=

"Forest scene"
 src="images/p133s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The forest scenes were intended to be the features of the
evening, and in these the young people fairly surpassed
themselves.&nbsp; Any one who had seen Neilson in her doublet and
hose of silver-grey, Modjeska in her shades of blue, and Ada
Cavendish in her lovely suit of green, might have thought
Bell&rsquo;s patched-up dress a sorry mixture; yet these three
brilliant stars in the theatrical firmament might have envied
this little Rosalind the dewy youth and freshness that so
triumphed over all deficiencies of costume.</p>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s camping-dress of grey, shortened to the knee,
served for its basis.&nbsp; Round the skirt and belt and sleeves
were broad bands of laurel-leaf trimming.&nbsp; She wore a pair
of Margery&rsquo;s long grey stockings and Laura&rsquo;s dainty
bronze Newport ties.&nbsp; A soft grey chudda shawl of Aunt
Truth&rsquo;s was folded into a mantle to swing from the
shoulder, its fringes being caught up out of sight, and a
laurel-leaf trimming added.&nbsp; On her bright wavy hair was
perched a cunning flat cap of leaves, and, as she entered with
Polly, leaning on her manzanita staff, and sighing, &lsquo;Oh
Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!&rsquo; one could not wish a
lovelier stage picture.</p>
<p>And so the play went on, with varying fortunes.&nbsp; Margery
was frightened to death, and persisted in taking
Touchstone&rsquo;s speeches right out of his mouth, much to his
discomfiture.&nbsp; Adam&rsquo;s beard refused to stay on; so did
the moustache of the Banished Duke, and the clothes of
Sylvius.&nbsp; But nothing could damp the dramatic fire of the
players, nor destroy the enthusiasm of the sympathetic
audience.</p>
<p>Dicky sat in the dress-circle, wrapped in blankets, and
laughed himself nearly into convulsions over Touchstone&rsquo;s
jokes, and the stage business of the Banished Duke; for it is
unnecessary to state that Jack was not strictly Shakespearean in
his treatment of the part.</p>
<p>As for Polly, she enjoyed being Celia with all her might, and
declared her intention of going immediately on the
&lsquo;regular&rsquo; stage; but Jack somewhat destroyed her
hopes by affirming that her nose and hair wouldn&rsquo;t be just
the thing on the metropolitan boards, although they might pass
muster in a backwoods theatre.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;Hello!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; exclaimed
Philip, one morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;A visitor?&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;no!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel
Felipe Hilario Noriega coming up the ca&ntilde;on!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got a loaded team, too!&nbsp; I wonder if Uncle Doc is
expecting anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The swarthy gentleman with the long name emerged from one
cloud of dust and disappeared in another, until he neared the
gate where Philip and Polly were standing.</p>
<p>Philip opened the gate, and received a bow of thanks which
would have made Manuel&rsquo;s reputation at a Spanish court.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going up to camp?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those things for us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly!&nbsp; Well, are there any letters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he drew one
from his gorgeously-decorated leather belt.</p>
<p>Philip reached for it, and Polly leaned over his shoulder,
devoured with curiosity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s for Aunt Truth,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;and&mdash;yes, I am sure it is Mrs. Howard&rsquo;s
writing; and if it is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, as Manuel spoke no English, and neither Philip nor
Polly could make inquiries in Spanish, Polly darted to the cart
in her usual meteoric style, put one foot on the hub of a wheel
and climbed to the top like a squirrel, snatched off a corner of
the canvas cover, and cried triumphantly, &lsquo;I knew it!&nbsp;
Elsie is coming!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a tent, and some mattresses
and pillows.&nbsp; Hurry!&nbsp; Help me down, quick!&nbsp; Oh,
slow-coach!&nbsp; Keep out of the way and I&rsquo;ll jump!&nbsp;
Give me the letter.&nbsp; I can run faster than you
can.&rsquo;&nbsp; And before the vestige of an idea had
penetrated Philip&rsquo;s head, nothing could be seen of Polly
but a pair of twinkling heels and the gleam of a curly head that
caught every ray of the sun and turned it into ruddier gold.</p>
<p>It was a dusty, rocky path, and up-hill at that; but Polly,
who was nothing if not ardent, never slackened her pace, but
dashed along until she came in sight of the camp, where she
expended her last breath in one shrill shriek for Aunt Truth.</p>
<p>It was responded to promptly.&nbsp; Indeed, it was the sort of
shriek that always commands instantaneous attention; and Aunt
Truth came out of her tent prepared to receive tragic news.&nbsp;
Bell followed; and the entire family would have done the same had
they been in camp.</p>
<p>Polly thrust the letter into Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s hand, and
sank down exhausted, exclaiming, breathlessly,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a mattress&mdash;and a tent&mdash;coming up
the ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Elsie&rsquo;s, I know.&nbsp;
Philip is down at the gate&mdash;with the cart&mdash;but I came
ahead.&nbsp; Phew! but it&rsquo;s warm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Bell, joyfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Elsie
at the gate!&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be true!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she
darted like an arrow through the trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come back! come back!&rsquo; screamed Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elsie is not at the gate.&nbsp; Don S. D. M. F. H. N.
is there with a team loaded down with things.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
it from Mrs. Howard, Aunt Truth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is.&nbsp; Written this morning from Tacitas
Rancho.&nbsp; Why, how is this?&nbsp; Let me see!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Tacitas
Rancho</span>, <i>Monday morning</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Truth</span>,&mdash;You will be
surprised to receive a letter from me, written from
Tacitas.&nbsp; But here we are, Elsie and I; and, what is better,
we are on our way to you.</p>
<p>(&lsquo;I knew it!&rsquo; exclaimed the girls.)</p>
<p>Elsie has been growing steadily better for three weeks.&nbsp;
The fever seems to have disappeared entirely, and the troublesome
cough is so much lessened that she sleeps all night without
waking.&nbsp; The doctor says that the camp-life will be the very
best thing for her now, and will probably complete her
recovery.</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Oh, joy, joy!&rsquo; cried the girls.)</p>
<p>I need not say how gladly we followed this special
prescription of our kind doctor&rsquo;s, nor add that we started
at once.</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Oh, Aunt Truth, there is nobody within a mile of the
camp; can&rsquo;t I, <i>please</i> can&rsquo;t I turn one little
hand-spring, just one little lady-like one?&rsquo; pleaded Polly,
dancing on one foot and chewing her sun-bonnet string.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, you can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Keep quiet and let me
read.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>Elsie would not let me tell you our plans any sooner, lest the
old story of a sudden ill turn would keep us at home; and I think
very likely that she longed to give the dear boys and girls a
surprise.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Burtons&rsquo; yesterday.&nbsp; Elsie bore
the journey exceedingly well, but I would not take any risks, and
so we shall not drive over until day after to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>(&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t have hurried quite so fast, Polly
dear.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>I venture to send the tent and its belongings ahead to-day, so
that Jack may get everything to rights before we arrive.</p>
<p>The mattress is just the size the girls ordered; and of course
I&rsquo;ve told Elsie nothing about the proposed furnishing of
her tent.</p>
<p>I am bringing my little China boy with me, for I happen to
think that, with the Burtons, we shall be fourteen at
table.&nbsp; Gin is not quite a success as a cook, but he can at
least wash dishes, wait at table, and help Hop Yet in various
ways; while I shall be only too glad to share all your
housekeeping cares, if you have not escaped them even in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>I shall be so glad to see you again; and oh, Truth, I am so
happy, so happy, that, please God, I can keep my child after
all!&nbsp; The weary burden of dread is lifted off my heart, and
I feel young again.&nbsp; Just think of it!&nbsp; My Elsie will
be well and strong once more!&nbsp; It seems too good to be
true.</p>
<p>Always your attached friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Janet
Howard</span>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s voice quivered as she read the last few
words, and Polly and Bell threw themselves into each
other&rsquo;s arms and cried for sheer gladness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, dears!&nbsp; I suppose you will make grand
preparations, and there is no time to lose.&nbsp; One of you must
find somebody to help Philip unload the team.&nbsp; Papa and the
boys have gone fishing, and Laura and Margery went with them, I
think.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Winship bustled about, literally on
hospitable thoughts in-tent.</p>
<p>Polly tied on her sun-bonnet with determination, turned up her
sleeves as if washing were the thing to be done, and placed her
arms akimbo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;First and foremost,&rsquo; said she, her eyes sparkling
with excitement, &lsquo;first and foremost, I am going to blow
the horn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Aunt Truth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are
you crazy, Polly?&nbsp; It is scarcely ten o&rsquo;clock, and
everybody would think it was dinnertime, and come home at
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, they&rsquo;d think something had happened to
Dicky,&rsquo; said Bell, &lsquo;and that would bring them in
still sooner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course!&nbsp; I forgot.&nbsp; But can&rsquo;t I blow
it earlier than usual?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I blow it at half-past
eleven instead of twelve?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t do a thing without
the boys, and they may not come home until midnight unless we do
something desperate.&nbsp; Oh, delight!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Don
S. D. M. F. H. N., and Phil has found Pancho to help
unload.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lucky that we decided on the place for
Elsie&rsquo;s tent, and saved it in case she should ever
come?&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now Philip and Pancho can
set it up whenever they choose.&nbsp; And isn&rsquo;t it
fortunate that we three stayed at home to-day, and refused to
fish? now we can plan everything, and then all work together when
they come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Polly was tugging at an immense bundle, literally
tooth and nail, as she alternated trembling clutches of the
fingers with frantic bites at the offending knot.</p>
<p>Like many of her performances, the physical strength expended
was out of all proportion to the result produced, and one stroke
of Philip&rsquo;s knife accomplished more than all her
ill-directed effort.&nbsp; At length the bundle of awning cloth
stood revealed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it beautiful?&rsquo;
she cried, &lsquo;it will be the very prettiest tent in camp;
can&rsquo;t I blow the horn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, mamma,&rsquo; exclaimed Bell, &lsquo;it is green
and grey, in those pretty broken stripes, and the edge is cut in
lovely scollops and bound with green braid.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it
look pretty among the trees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Truth came out to join the admiring group.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O-o-o-h!&rsquo; screamed Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
comes a piece of the floor.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve sent it all made,
in three pieces.&nbsp; What fun!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have it all up
and ready to sleep in before we blow the horn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s a roll of straw matting,&rsquo; said
Phil, depositing a huge bundle on the ground near the
girls.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cut the rope to save your
teeth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Green and white plaid!&rsquo; exclaimed Bell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; Mrs. Howard did have her wits about
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, do let me blow the horn!&rsquo; teased the
irrepressible Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here are a looking-glass and a towel-rack and a Shaker
rocking-chair,&rsquo; called Philip; &lsquo;guess they&rsquo;re
going to stay the rest of the summer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course they wouldn&rsquo;t want a looking-glass
if they were only going to stay a month or two,&rsquo; laughed
Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Aunt Truth, if you won&rsquo;t let me turn a
single decorous little hand-spring, or blow the horn, or do
anything nice, will you let us use all that new white
mosquito-netting?&nbsp; Bell says that it has been in the
storehouse for two years, and it would be just the thing for
decorating Elsie&rsquo;s tent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course you may have it, Polly, and anything
else that you can find.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I hear Dicky&rsquo;s
voice in the distance; perhaps the girls are coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bell and Polly darted through the swarm of tents, and looked
up the narrow path that led to the brook.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Margery and Laura were strolling towards home
with little Anne and Dick dangling behind, after the manner of
children.&nbsp; Margery carried a small string of trout, and Dick
the inevitable tin pail in which he always kept an unfortunate
frog or two.&nbsp; The girls had discovered that he was in the
habit of crowding the cover tightly over the pail and keeping his
victims shut up for twenty-four hours, after which, he said, they
were nice and tame&mdash;so very tame, as it transpired, that
they generally gave up the ghost in a few hours after their
release.&nbsp; Margery had with difficulty persuaded him of his
cruelty, and the cover had been pierced with a certain number of
air-holes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guess the loveliest thing that could possibly
happen!&rsquo; called Bell at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elsie has come,&rsquo; answered Margery in a second,
nobody knew why; &lsquo;let me hug her this minute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With those fish?&rsquo; laughed Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No!
you&rsquo;ll have to wait until day after to-morrow, and then
your guess will be right.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it almost too good to
be true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she is almost well,&rsquo; added Bell, joyfully,
slipping her arm through Margery&rsquo;s and squeezing it in
sheer delight.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Howard says she is really and
truly better.&nbsp; Oh, if Elsie Howard in bed is the loveliest,
dearest thing in the world, what will it be like to have her out
of it and with us in all our good times!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she always been ill since you knew her?&rsquo;
asked Laura.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; a terrible cold left her with weakness of the
lungs, and the doctors feared consumption, but thought that she
might possibly outgrow it entirely if she lived in a milder
climate; so Mrs. Howard left home and everybody she cared for,
and brought Elsie to Santa Barbara.&nbsp; Papa has taken an
interest in her from the first, and as far as we girls are
concerned, it was love at first sight.&nbsp; You never knew
anybody like Elsie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she pretty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty!&rsquo; cried Polly, &lsquo;she is like an angel
in a picture-book!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Interesting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Interesting!&rsquo; said Bell, in a tone that showed
the word to be too feeble for the subject; &lsquo;Elsie is more
interesting than all the other girls in the other world put
together!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Popular?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Popular!&rsquo; exclaimed Margery, taking her turn in
the oral examination, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether anybody
can be popular who is always in bed; but if it&rsquo;s popular to
be adored by every man, woman, child, and animal that comes
anywhere near her, why then Elsie is popular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is she a favourite with boys as well as
girls?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Favourite!&rsquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, they
think that she is simply perfect!&nbsp; Of course she has
scarcely been able to sit up a week at a time for a year, and
naturally she has not seen many people; but, if you want a
boy&rsquo;s opinion, just ask Philip or Geoffrey.&nbsp; I assure
you, Laura, after you have known Elsie a while, and have seen the
impression she makes upon everybody, you will want to go to bed
and see if you can do likewise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t just the going to bed,&rsquo; remarked
Margery, sagely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it isn&rsquo;t the prettiness either,&rsquo; added
Polly; &lsquo;though if you saw Elsie asleep, a flower in one
hand, the other under her cheek, her hair straying over the
pillow (O for hair that would stray anywhere!), you would expect
every moment to see a halo above her head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is because she is good that
everybody admires her so,&rsquo; said Laura, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
think goodness in itself is always so very interesting; if Elsie
had freckles and a snub nose&rsquo;&mdash;(&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
mind me!&rsquo; murmured Polly)&mdash;&lsquo;you would find that
people would say less about her wonderful character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are things that puzzle me,&rsquo; said Polly,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems to me that if I could
contrive to be ever so good, nobody ever would look for a halo
round my head.&nbsp; Now, is it my turned-up nose and red hair
that make me what I am, or did what I am make my nose and hair
what they are&mdash;which?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have to ask Aunt Truth,&rsquo; said
Margery; &lsquo;that is too difficult a thing for us to
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it nice I catched that big bull-frog,
Margie?&rsquo; cried Dick, his eyes shining with
anticipation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have as many as seven
or &rsquo;leven frogs and lots of horned toads when Elsie comes,
and she can help me play with &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the girls reached the tents again, the last article had
been taken from the team and Manuel had driven away.&nbsp; The
sound of Phil&rsquo;s hammer could be heard from the
carpenter-shop, and Pancho was already laying the tent floor in a
small, open, sunny place, where the low boughs of a single
sycamore hung so as to protect one of its corners, leaving the
rest to the full warmth of the sunshine that was to make Elsie
entirely well again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am tired to death,&rsquo; sighed Laura, throwing
herself down in a bamboo lounging-chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such a
tramp as we had! and after all, the boys insisted on going where
Dr. Winship wouldn&rsquo;t allow us to follow, so that we had to
stay behind and fish with the children; I wish I had stayed at
home and read <i>The Colonel&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Laura!&rsquo; remonstrated Margery, &lsquo;think of
that lovely pool with the forests of maiden-hair growing all
about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And poison-oak,&rsquo; grumbled Laura.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know I walked into some of it and shall look like a perfect
fright for a week.&nbsp; I shall never make a country
girl&mdash;it&rsquo;s no use for me to try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use for you to try walking four miles in
high-heeled shoes, my dear,&rsquo; said Polly, bluntly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not high,&rsquo; retorted Laura, &lsquo;and if
they are, I don&rsquo;t care to look like
a&mdash;a&mdash;cow-boy, even in the backwoods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m an awful example,&rsquo; sighed Polly,
seating herself on a stump in front of the tent, and elevating a
very dusty little common-sense boot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir Walter
Raleigh would never have allowed me to walk on his velvet cloak
with that boot, would he, girls?&nbsp; Oh, wasn&rsquo;t that
romantic, though? and don&rsquo;t I wish that I had been Queen
Elizabeth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got the <i>hair</i>,&rsquo; said
Laura.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&nbsp; I had forgotten Elizabeth&rsquo;s hair
was red; so it was.&nbsp; This is my court train,&rsquo;
snatching a tablecloth that bung on a hush near by, and pinning
it to her waist in the twinkling of an eye,&mdash;&lsquo;this my
farthingale,&rsquo; dangling her sun-bonnet from her
belt,&mdash;&lsquo;this my sceptre,&rsquo; seizing a Japanese
umbrella,&mdash;&lsquo;this my crown,&rsquo; inverting a bright
tin plate upon her curly head.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is just alighting
from her chariot, <i>thus</i>; the courtiers turn pale,
<i>thus</i>; (why don&rsquo;t you do it?) what shall be
done?&nbsp; The Royal Feet must not be wet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go round
the puddle?&nbsp; Prit, me Lud, &rsquo;Od&rsquo;s body!&nbsp;
Forsooth!&nbsp; Certainly not!&nbsp; Remove the puddle!&rdquo;
she says haughtily to her subjects.&nbsp; They are just about to
do so, when out from behind a neighbouring chaparral bush stalks
a beautiful young prince with coal-black hair and rose-red
cheeks.&nbsp; He wears a rich velvet cloak, glittering with
embroidery.&nbsp; He sees not her crown, her hair outshines it;
he sees not her sceptre, her tiny hand conceals it; he sees
naught save the loathly mud.&nbsp; He strips off his cloak and
floats it on the puddle.&nbsp; With a haughty but gracious bend
of her head the Queen accepts the courtesy; crosses the puddle,
<i>thus</i>, waves her sceptre, <i>thus</i>, and saying,
&ldquo;You shall hear from me by return mail, me Lud,&rdquo; she
vanishes within the castle.&nbsp; The next morning she makes Sir
Walter British Minister to Florida.&nbsp; He departs at once with
a cargo of tobacco, which he exchanges for sweet potatoes, and
everybody is happy ever after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girls were convulsed with mirth at this historical
romance, and, as Mrs. Winship wiped the tears of merriment from
her eyes, Polly seized the golden opportunity and dropped on her
knees beside her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, Aunt Truth, we can&rsquo;t get the white
mosquito-netting because Dr. Winship has the key of the
storehouse in his pocket, and so&mdash;may&mdash;I&mdash;blow the
horn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Winship gave her consent in despair, and Polly went to
the oak-tree where the horn hung and blew all the strength of her
lungs into blast after blast for five minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I needed,&rsquo; she said, on
returning; &lsquo;that was an escape-valve, and I shall be
lady-like and well-behaved the rest of the day.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">QUEEN ELSIE VISITS THE COURT</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;An hour and friend with friend will
meet,<br />
Lip cling to lip and hand clasp hand.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Laura,&rsquo; asked
Bell, when quiet was restored, &lsquo;advise us about
Elsie&rsquo;s tent.&nbsp; We want it to be perfectly lovely; and
you have such good taste!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me think,&rsquo; said Laura.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, if
she were only a brunette instead of a blonde, we could festoon
the tent with that yellow tarlatan I brought for the
play!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What difference does it make whether she is dark or
light?&rsquo; asked Bell, obtusely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, a room ought to be as becoming as a dress&mdash;so
Mrs. Pinkerton says.&nbsp; You know I saw a great deal of her at
the hotel; and oh, girls! her bedroom was the most exquisite
thing you ever saw!&nbsp; She had a French toilet-table, covered
with pale blue silk and white marquise lace,&mdash;perfectly
lovely,&mdash;with yards and yards of robin&rsquo;s-egg blue
watered ribbon in bows; and on it she kept all her toilet
articles, everything in hammered silver from Tiffany&rsquo;s with
monograms on the back,&mdash;three or four sizes of brushes, and
combs, and mirrors, and a full manicure set.&nbsp; It used to
take her two hours to dress; but it was worth it.&nbsp; Oh, such
gorgeous tea-gowns as she had!&nbsp; One of old rose and lettuce
was a perfect dream!&nbsp; She always had her breakfast in bed,
you know.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s delightful to have your
breakfast before you get up, and dress as slowly as you
like.&nbsp; I wish mamma would let me do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does she do after she gets dressed in her rows of
old lettuce&mdash;I mean her old rows of lettuce?&rsquo; asked
Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do?&nbsp; Why really, Polly, you are too stupid!&nbsp;
What do you suppose she did?&nbsp; What everybody else does, of
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Polly, apologetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old is Mrs. Pinkerton?&rsquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Between nineteen and twenty.&nbsp; There is not three
years&rsquo; difference in our ages, though she has been married
nearly two years.&nbsp; It seems so funny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only nineteen!&rsquo; cried Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I
always thought that she was old as the hills&mdash;twenty-five or
thirty at the very least.&nbsp; She always seemed tired of
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Laura, in a whisper intended to be
too low to reach Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s tent, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether I ought to repeat what was told me in confidence,
but the fact is&mdash;well&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t like Mr.
Pinkerton very well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other girls, who had not enjoyed the advantages of city
life and travel, looked as dazed as any scandalmonger could have
desired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t like him!&rsquo; gasped Polly, nearly
falling off the stump.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s married to
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where on earth were you brought up?&rsquo; snapped
Laura.&nbsp; &lsquo;What difference does that make?&nbsp; She
can&rsquo;t help it if she doesn&rsquo;t happen to like her
husband, can she?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t make yourself like
anybody, can you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, did she ever like him?&rsquo; asked Margery;
&lsquo;for she&rsquo;s only been married a year or two, and it
seems to me it might have lasted that long if there was anything
to begin on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; whispered Laura, mysteriously, &lsquo;you
see Mr. Pinkerton was very rich and the Dentons very poor.&nbsp;
Mr. Denton had just died, leaving them nothing at all to live on,
and poor Jessie would have had to teach school, or some dreadful
thing like that.&nbsp; The thought of it almost killed her, she
is so sensitive and so refined.&nbsp; She never told me so in so
many words, but I am sure she married Mr. Pinkerton to save her
mother from poverty; and I pity her from the bottom of my
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it was noble,&rsquo; said Bell, in a puzzled
tone, &lsquo;if she couldn&rsquo;t think of any other way,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, did she try very hard to think of other
ways?&rsquo; asked Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She never looked
especially noble to me.&nbsp; I thought she seemed like a
die-away, frizzlygig kind of a girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish, Miss Oliver, that you would be kind enough to
remember that Mrs. Pinkerton is one of my most intimate
friends,&rsquo; said Laura, sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I do wish,
also, that you wouldn&rsquo;t talk loud enough to be heard all
through the ca&ntilde;on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The colour came into Polly&rsquo;s cheeks, but before she
could answer, Mrs. Winship walked in, stocking-basket in hand,
and seated herself in the little wicker rocking-chair.&nbsp;
Polly&rsquo;s clarion tones had given her a clue to the subject,
and she thought the discussion needed guidance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were talking about Mrs. Pinkerton, girls,&rsquo;
she said, serenely.&nbsp; &lsquo;You say you are fond of her,
Laura, dear, and it seems very ungracious for me to criticise
your friend; that is a thing which most of us fail to bear
patiently.&nbsp; But I cannot let you hold her up as an ideal to
be worshipped, or ask the girls to admire as a piece of
self-denial what I fear was nothing but indolence and
self-gratification.&nbsp; You are too young to talk of these
things very much; but you are not too young to make up your mind
that when you agree to live all your life long with a person, you
must have some other feeling than a determination not to teach
school.&nbsp; Jessie Denton&rsquo;s mother, my dear Laura, would
never have asked the sacrifice of her daughter&rsquo;s whole
life; and Jessie herself would never have made it had she been
less vain, proud, and luxurious in her tastes, and a little
braver, more self-forgetting and industrious.&nbsp; These are
hard words, dear, and I am sorry to use them.&nbsp; She has
gained the riches she wanted,&mdash;the carriages and servants,
and tea-gowns, and hammered silver from Tiffany&rsquo;s, but she
looks tired and disappointed, as Bell says; and I&rsquo;ve no
doubt she is, poor girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do her justice, Mrs. Winship; I
don&rsquo;t, indeed,&rsquo; said Laura.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are really attached to her, Laura, don&rsquo;t
make the mistake of admiring her faults of character, but try to
find her better qualities, and help her to develop them.&nbsp; It
is a fatal thing when girls of your age set up these false
standards, and order their lives by them.&nbsp; There are worse
things than school-teaching, yes, or even floor-scrubbing or
window-washing.&nbsp; Lovely tea-gowns and silver-backed brushes
are all very pretty and nice to have, if they are not gained at
the sacrifice of something better.&nbsp; I should have said to my
daughter, had I been Mrs. Denton, &ldquo;We will work for each
other, my darling, and try to do whatever God gives us to do;
but, no matter how hard life is, your heart is the most precious
thing in the world, and you must never sell that, if we part with
everything else.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, my girls, my girls, if I could
only make you believe that &ldquo;poor and content is rich, and
rich enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot bear to think of your growing
year by year into the conviction that these pretty glittering
things of wealth are the true gold of life which everybody
seeks.&nbsp; Forgive me, Laura, if I have hurt your
feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you would never hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings,
if you could help it, Mrs. Winship,&rsquo; Laura answered, with a
hint of coldness in her voice, &lsquo;though I can&rsquo;t help
thinking that you are a little hard on poor Jessie; but, even
then, one can surely like a person without wishing to do the very
same things she does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is true,&rsquo; said Mrs. Winship,
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;But one cannot constantly justify a wrong
action in another without having one&rsquo;s own standard
unconsciously lowered.&nbsp; What we continually excuse in other
people we should be inclined by and by to excuse in
ourselves.&nbsp; Let us choose our friends as wisely as possible,
and love them dearly, helping them to grow worthier of our love
at the same time we are trying to grow worthier of theirs;
because &ldquo;we live by admiration, hope, and love,&rdquo; you
know, but not by admiring and loving the wrong things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is the horn, and I hear the boys.&nbsp; Let
us come to luncheon, and tell our good news of Elsie.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Long before the boys appeared in sight, their voices rang
through the ca&ntilde;on in a chorus that woke the echoes, and
presently they came into view, bearing two quarters and a saddle
of freshly killed mutton, hanging from a leafy branch swung
between Jack&rsquo;s sturdy shoulder and Geoff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A splendid &ldquo;still hunt&rdquo; this morning, Aunt
Truth!&rsquo; exclaimed Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;Game plenty and not
too shy, dogs in prime condition, hunters ditto.&nbsp; Behold the
result!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girls could scarcely tell whether or no Laura was offended
at Aunt Truth&rsquo;s unexpected little lecture.&nbsp; She did
not appear quite as unrestrained as usual, but as everybody was
engaged in the preparations for Elsie&rsquo;s welcome there was a
general atmosphere of hilarity and confusion, so that no
awkwardness was possible.</p>
<p>The tool-shop resounded with blows of hammer and steel.&nbsp;
Dicky was under everybody&rsquo;s feet, and his &lsquo;seven or
ten frogs,&rsquo; together with his unrivalled collection of
horned toads, were continually escaping from their tin pails and
boxes in the various tents, and everybody was obliged to join in
the search to recover and re-incarcerate them, in order to keep
the peace.</p>
<p>Hop Yet was making a gold and silver cake, with
&lsquo;Elsie&rsquo; in pink letters on chocolate frosting.&nbsp;
Philip had pitched the new tent so that in one corner there was a
slender manzanita-tree which had been cropped for some purpose or
other.&nbsp; He had nailed a cross-piece on this, so that it
resembled the letter T, and was now laboriously boring holes and
fitting in pegs, that Elsie might have a sort of closet behind
her bed.</p>
<p>As for the rustic furniture, the girls and boys declared it to
be too beautiful for words.&nbsp; They stood in circles about it
and admired it without reserve, each claiming that his own
special piece of work was the gem of the collection.&nbsp; The
sunlight shining through the grey and green tints of the tent was
voted perfection, Philip&rsquo;s closet a miracle of ingenuity,
the green and white straw matting an inspiration.</p>
<p>The looking-glass had been mounted on a packing-box, and
converted by Laura into a dressing-table that rivalled Mrs.
Pinkerton&rsquo;s; for green tarlatan and white mosquito-netting
had been so skilfully combined that the traditional mermaid might
have been glad to make her toilet there &lsquo;with a comb and a
glass in her hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; The rest of the green and white
gauzy stuff had been looped from the corners of the tent to the
centre of the roof-piece, and delicate tendrils of wild clematis
climbed here and there as if it were growing, its roots plunged
in cunningly hidden bottles of water.&nbsp; Bell had gone about
with pieces of awning cloth and green braid, and stitched an
elaborate system of pockets on the inside of the tent wherever
they would not be too prominent.&nbsp; There were tiny pockets
for needle-work, thimbles, and scissors, medium-sized pockets for
soap and combs and brushes, bigger pockets for shoes and slippers
and stockings, and mammoth pockets for anything else that Elsie
might ordain to put in a pocket.</p>
<p>By four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Margery had used her
clever fingers to such purpose that a white silesia flag, worked
with the camp name, floated from the tip top of the front
entrance to the tent.&nbsp; The ceremony of raising the flag was
attended with much enthusiasm, and its accomplishment greeted by
a deafening cheer from the entire party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless one wants Paradise,&rsquo; sighed Margery,
&lsquo;who wouldn&rsquo;t be contented with dear Camp
Chaparral?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who would live in a house, any way?&rsquo; exclaimed
Philip.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sniff this air, and look up at that
sky!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this is what they call &ldquo;roughing it,&rdquo;
in Santa Barbara,&rsquo; quoth Dr. Winship.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you
youngsters have made that tent fit for the occupancy of a society
belle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, let&rsquo;s organise for reception!&rsquo; cried
Geoffrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Assemble, good people!&nbsp; Come over
here, Aunt Truth!&nbsp; I will take the chair myself, since I
don&rsquo;t happen to see anybody who would fill it with more
dignity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to mount my broncho and go out on the road
to meet my beloved family,&rsquo; said Jack, sauntering up to the
impromptu council-chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you tell when they will arrive?&rsquo; asked
Mrs. Winship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can make a pretty good guess.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
probably start from Tacitas as early as eight or nine
o&rsquo;clock, if Elsie is well.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see:
it&rsquo;s about twenty-five miles, isn&rsquo;t it, Uncle
Doc?&nbsp; Say twenty-three to the place where they turn off the
main road.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll take a bit of lunch, ride out
ten or twelve miles, hitch my horse in the shade, and
wait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Geoffrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not
usual for committees to appoint themselves, but as you are a near
relative of our distinguished guests we will grant you special
consideration and order you to the front.&nbsp; Ladies and
gentlemen, passing over the slight informality of the nomination,
all in favour of appointing Mr. John Howard Envoy Extraordinary
please manifest it by the usual sign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Six persons yelled &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; four raised the right
hand, and one stood up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There seems to be a slight difference of opinion as to
the usual sign.&nbsp; All right.&mdash;Contrary
minded!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; shouted Polly, at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a unanimous vote,&rsquo; said Geoffrey,
crushingly, bringing down his fist as an imaginary gavel with
incredible force and dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dr. and Mrs. Winship,
will you oblige the Chair by acting as a special Reception
Committee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; responded the doctor,
smilingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will the Chair kindly outline the general
policy of the committee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hm-m-m!&nbsp; Yes, certainly&mdash;of course.&nbsp; The
Chair suggests that the Reception Committee&mdash;well, that they
stay at home and&mdash;receive the guests,&mdash;yes, that will
do very nicely.&nbsp;
All-in-favour-and-so-forth-it-is-a-vote-and-so-ordered.&nbsp;
Secretary will please spread a copy on the minutes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Gavel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I rise to a point of order,&rsquo; said Jack,
sagely.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no secretary and there are no
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mere form,&rsquo; said the Chair; &lsquo;sit down;
there will be minutes in a minute,&mdash;got to do some more
things first; that will do, <i>sit down</i>.&nbsp; Will the
Misses Burton and Messrs. Burton and Noble kindly act as
Committee on Decoration?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the Committee on Music, and Refreshments,
and Olympian Games, and all that sort of thing?&rsquo;
interrupted Polly, who had not the slightest conception of
parliamentary etiquette; &lsquo;and why don&rsquo;t you hurry up
and put me on something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Miss Oliver refuses to bridle her tongue, and
persists in interrupting the business of the meeting, the Chair
will be obliged to remove her,&rsquo; said Geoffrey, with
chilling emphasis.</p>
<p>Polly rose again, undaunted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would respectfully
ask the Chair, who put him in the chair, any way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Question!&rsquo; roared Philip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Second the motion!&rsquo; shrieked Bell, that being the
only parliamentary expression she knew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Order!&rsquo; cried Geoffrey in stentorian
accents.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will adjourn the meeting and clear the
court-room unless there is order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do!&rsquo; remarked Polly, encouragingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will rise again, like Ph&oelig;bus, from my ashes, to
say that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Jack sprang to his feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would suggest to
the Chair that the last speaker amend her motion by substituting
the word &ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix&rdquo; for
&ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accept the amendment,&rsquo; said Polly, serenely,
amidst the general hilarity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Question!&rsquo; called Bell, with another mighty
projection of memory into a missionary meeting that she had once
attended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not aware that there is any motion before the
house,&rsquo; said Geoffrey, cuttingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Second the motion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Second the amendment!&rsquo; shouted the girls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladies, there <i>is</i> no motion.&nbsp; Will you
oblige the Chair by remaining quiet until speech is
requested?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Move that the meeting be adjourned and another one
called, with a new Chair!&rsquo; remarked Margery, who felt that
the honour of her sex was at stake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Move that this motion be so ordered and spread upon the
minutes, and a copy of it be presented to the Chairman,&rsquo;
suggested Philip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Move that the copy be appropriately bound in
<i>calf</i>,&rsquo; said Jack, dodging an imaginary blow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Move that the other committees be elected by
ballot,&rsquo; concluded Scott Burton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is simply disgraceful!&rsquo; exclaimed the
Chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Order! order!&nbsp; I appoint Miss Oliver
Committee on Entertainment, with a view of keeping her
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was received with particular as well as general
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Winship, we appoint you Committee on
Music.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; Do you wish it to be
original?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not; we wish it to be good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we only know one chorus, and that&rsquo;s &ldquo;My
Witching Dinah Snow.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind; either write new words to that tune or sing
tra-la-la to it.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Winship, the Chair appoints
you Committee on Menagerie, and suggests that as we have
proclaimed a legal holiday, you give your animals the freedom of
the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know what freedom of er city means,&rsquo;
said Dicky, who feared that he was being made the butt of
ridicule.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, we want you to allow the captives to parade in the
evening, with torch-lights and mottoes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; cried Dicky, kindling in an instant;
&lsquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; Luby, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the doat,
&rsquo;n&rsquo; my horn&rsquo; toads, all e&rsquo;cept the one
that just gotted away in Laura&rsquo;s bed; but may be
she&rsquo;ll find him to-night, so they&rsquo;ll be all
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for the various committees, and
Laura&rsquo;s wild shriek was the signal for a hasty
adjournment.&nbsp; A common danger restored peace to the
assembly, and they sought the runaway in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jack, when quiet was restored,
&lsquo;I am going a little distance up the Pico Negro trail;
there are some magnificent Spanish bayonets growing there, and if
you&rsquo;ll let me have Pancho, Uncle Doc, we can bring down
four of them and lash them to each of the corners of
Elsie&rsquo;s tent,&mdash;they&rsquo;ll keep fresh several days
in water, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take him, certainly,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do let me go with you!&rsquo; pleaded Laura, with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like the walk so
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s pretty rough, Laura,&rsquo; objected
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you couldn&rsquo;t endure our walk this
morning, you would never get home alive from Pico
Negro.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that was in the heat of the day,&rsquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel equal to any amount of walking now,
if Jack doesn&rsquo;t mind taking me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delighted, of course, Miss Laura.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be
willing to carry home one of the trees, I suppose, in return for
the pleasure of my society?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Snub him severely, Laura,&rsquo; cried Bell; &lsquo;we
never allow him to say such things unreproved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he is snubbed too much already,&rsquo; replied
Laura, with a charming smile, &lsquo;and I shall see how a course
of encouragement will affect his behaviour.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;That will be what I long have sought,<br />
And mourned because I found it not,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sang Jack, nonchalantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Laura,&rsquo; remonstrated Bell, &lsquo;think twice
before you encourage him in his dreadful ways.&nbsp; We have
studied him very carefully, and we know that the only way to live
with him is to keep him in a sort of &ldquo;pint pot&rdquo; where
we can hold the lid open just a little, and clap it down suddenly
whenever he tries to spring out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not mind that young person, Miss Laura, but form
your own impressions of my charming character.&nbsp; Excuse me,
please, while I put on a celluloid collar, and make some few
changes in my toilet necessary to a proper appearance in your
distinguished company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I prefer you as you are,&rsquo; answered Laura,
laughingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us start at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you hear that, young person?&nbsp; She prefers me as
I are!&nbsp; Now see what magic power her generosity has upon
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he darted into the tent, from which he
issued in a moment with his Derby hat, a manzanita cane, a
pocket-handkerchief tied about his throat, and a flower pinned on
his flannel camping-shirt&mdash;a most ridiculous figure, since
nothing seems so out of place in the woods as any suggestion of
city costumes or customs.&nbsp; Laura was in high good-humour,
and looked exceedingly brilliant and pretty, as she always did
when she was the central figure of any group or the bright
particular star of any occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be home before dark,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pancho, keep a look-out for the pack-mule.&nbsp; Truth,
one of the pack-mules has disappeared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So?&nbsp; Dumpling or Ditto?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ditto, curiously enough.&nbsp; His name should have led
him not to set an example, but to follow one.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Elsie came.</p>
<p>Perhaps you thought that this was going to be an exciting
story, and that something would happen to keep her at the Tacitas
ranch; but nothing did.&nbsp; Everything came to pass exactly as
it was arranged, and Jack met his mother and sister at twelve
o&rsquo;clock some four miles from the camp, and escorted them to
the gates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; had been painted on twenty different
boards or bits of white cloth and paper, and nailed here and
there on the trees that lined the rough wood-road; the strains of
an orchestra, formed of a guitar, banjo, castanets, Chinese
fiddle, and tin cans, greeted them from a distance, but were
properly allowed to die away in silence when the guest neared the
tents.&nbsp; Everything wore a new and smiling face, and Elsie
never came more dangerously near being squeezed to death.</p>
<p>Elsie, in the prettiest of gingham dresses, and her cloud of
golden hair braided in two funny little pugs to keep it out of
the dust; Elsie, with a wide hat that shaded her face, already a
little tanned and burned, no longer colourless; Elsie, with no
lines of pain in her pretty forehead, and the hollow ring gone
from her voice; Elsie, who jumped over the wheel of the wagon,
and hugged her huggers with the strength of a young bear!&nbsp;
It was too good to believe, and nobody did quite believe it for
days.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the happiest party in the world
assembled at the rough dining-table under the sycamore-trees.</p>
<p>Elsie beamed upon the feast from the high-backed manzanita
chair, a faint colour in her cheeks, and starry prisms of light
in a pair of eyes that had not sparkled for many a weary
month.&nbsp; Hop Yet smiled a trifle himself, wore his cap with a
red button on the top to wait upon the table, and ministered to
the hungry people with more interest and alacrity than he had
shown since he had been dragged from Santa Barbara, his Joss, and
his nightly game of fantan.&nbsp; And such a dinner as he had
prepared in honour of the occasion!&mdash;longer by four courses
than usual, and each person was allowed two plates in the course
of the meal.</p>

<p>And last of all, a surprise of Bell&rsquo;s, flapjacks, long
teased for by the boys, and prepared and fried by her own hands
while the merry party waited at table, to get them smoking
hot.</p>
<p>She came in flushed with heat and pride, the prettiest cook
anybody ever saw, with her hair bobbed up out of the way and
doing its best to escape, a high-necked white apron, sleeves
rolled up to the elbow, and an insinuating spot of batter in the
dimple of her left cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; she cried, joyfully, as she deposited a
heaping plate in front of her mother, and set the tin can of
maple syrup by its side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begin on those, and
I&rsquo;ll fry like lightning on two griddles to keep up with
you,&rsquo; and she rushed to the brush kitchen to turn her next
instalments that had been left to brown.&nbsp; Hop Yet had
retired to a distant spot by the brook, and was washing
dish-towels.&nbsp; All Chinese cooks are alike in their horror of
a woman in the kitchen; but some of them will unbend so far as to
allow her to amuse herself so long as they are not required to
witness the disagreeable spectacle.</p>
<p>Bell delicately inserted the cake-turner under the curled
edges of the flapjacks and turned them over deftly, using a
little too much force, perhaps, in the downward stroke when she
flung them back on the griddle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seems to me they come down with considerable of a
thud,&rsquo; she said, reflectively.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope
they&rsquo;re not tough, for I should never hear the last of
it.&nbsp; Guess I&rsquo;ll punch one with the handle of this tin
shovel, and see how it acts.&nbsp; Goodness! it&rsquo;s sort
of&mdash;elastic.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s funny.&nbsp; Well, perhaps
it&rsquo;s the way they ought to look.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here she
transferred the smoking mysteries to her plate, passed a bit of
pork over the griddles, and, after ladling out eight more, flew
off to the group at the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they good?&rsquo; she was beginning to ask, when
the words were frozen on her lips by the sight of a significant
tableau.</p>
<p>The four boys were standing on the bench that served instead
of dining-chairs, each with a plate and a pancake on the table in
front of them.&nbsp; Jack held a hammer and spike, Scott Burton a
hatchet, Geoffrey a saw, and Philip a rifle.&nbsp; Bell was
nothing if not intuitive.&nbsp; No elaborate explanations ever
were needed to show her a fact.&nbsp; Without a word she flung
the plate of flapjacks she held as far into a thicket as she had
force to fling it, and then dropped on her knees.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shoot, if you must, this old grey
head,<br />
But spare my flapjacks, sirs,&rdquo; she said!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with them?&nbsp; Tough?&nbsp; I
refuse to believe it.&nbsp; Your tools are too
dull,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Use more energy!&nbsp;
Nothing in this world can be accomplished without
effort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re a lovely brown,&rsquo; began Mrs.
Winship, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And they have a very good flavour,&rsquo; added
Elsie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch them, dearest!&rsquo; cried Bell,
snatching the plate from under Elsie&rsquo;s very nose.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have you made ill by my failures.&nbsp; But
as for the boys, I don&rsquo;t care a fig for them.&nbsp; Let
them make flapjacks more to their taste, the odious things!&nbsp;
Polly Oliver, did you put in that baking powder, as I told you,
while I went for the pork?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly blanched.&nbsp; &lsquo;Baking powder?&rsquo; she
faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, baking powder!&nbsp; B-A-K-I-N-G
P-O-W-D-E-R!&nbsp; Do I make myself plain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, baking powder, to be sure.&nbsp; Well, now that you
mention the matter, I do remember that Dicky called me away just
as I was getting it; and now that I think of it, Elsie came just
afterwards, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s the whole of my story, O,&rsquo; sang
Jack.&nbsp; &lsquo;I recommend the criminal to the mercy of the
court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A case of too many cooks,&rsquo; laughed Dr.
Winship.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cheer up, girls; better fortune next
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are eight more of them burning on the griddles
this moment, Polly,&rsquo; said Bell, scathingly; &lsquo;and as
they are yours, not mine, I advise you to throw them in the
brook, with the rest of the batter, so that Hop Yet won&rsquo;t
know that there has been a failure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some people blight everything they touch,&rsquo; sighed
Polly, gloomily, as she departed for the kitchen.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;But when I lie
in the green kirkyard&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Polly, dear,&rsquo; interrupted Margery,
&lsquo;that apology will not serve any longer; you&rsquo;ve used
it too often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is going to be entirely different,&rsquo;
continued Polly, tragically.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But when I lie in the green kirkyard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the mould upon my breasts<br />
Say not that she made flapjacks well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only, she did her best.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;We promise!&rsquo; cried Bell.</p>

188</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">POLLY&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY: FIRST HALF IN
WHICH SHE REJOICES AT THE MERE FACT OF HER EXISTENCE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O frabjous day!&nbsp; Calooh!&nbsp;
Callay!&rdquo;<br />
He chortled in his joy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Polly&rsquo;s</span> birthday dawned
auspiciously.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock she was kissed out of a
sound sleep by Bell and Margery, and the three girls slipped on
their wrappers, and prepared to run through the trees for a
morning plunge in Mirror Pool.&nbsp; Although it was August there
was still water enough in Minnehaha Brook to give one a
refreshing dip.&nbsp; Mirror Pool was a quarter of a mile distant
and well guarded with rocks and deep hidden in trees; but a
little pathway had been made to the water&rsquo;s edge, and thus
the girls had easy access to what they called The Mermaid&rsquo;s
Bath.&nbsp; A bay-tree was adorned with a little redwood sign,
which bore a picture of a mermaid, drawn by Margery, and below
the name these lines in rustic letters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A
hidden brook,<br />
That to the sleeping woods all night<br />
Singeth a quiet tune.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laura had not lived long enough in the woods to enjoy these
cold plunges; and, as her ideal was a marble tub, with scented
water, and a French maid to apply the same with a velvet sponge,
it is not much wonder.&nbsp; She insisted that, though it was
doubtless a very romantic proceeding, the bottom and sides of the
natural tub were quite too rocky and rough for her taste, and
that she should be in constant terror of snakes curling round her
toes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to wake Laura, just for
once,&rsquo; said Bell, opening the tent door.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
never was such a morning!&nbsp; (I believe I&rsquo;ve said that
regularly every day; but I simply never can get used to
it.)&nbsp; There must have been a wonderful sunrise, dears, for
the glow hasn&rsquo;t faded yet.&nbsp; Not a bit of morning
fog&mdash;that&rsquo;s good for Elsie.&nbsp; And what a lovely
day for a birthday!&nbsp; Did they use to give you anything like
this in Vermont, Polly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hardly,&rsquo; said Polly, peering over Bell&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&nbsp; What did they give
us in Vermont this month?&nbsp; Why, I can&rsquo;t think of
anything but dog-days, hot nights, and hay fever; but that sounds
ungrateful.&nbsp; Why, Geoff&rsquo;s up already!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Elsie&rsquo;s bunch of vines, and twigs, and pretty
things hanging on her tent-door.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been off on
horseback.&nbsp; Just my luck to have him get up first.&nbsp;
Jack always does, you know; and last night I sewed up the
tent-opening with carpet-thread, good and tight,
overhand&mdash;stitches I wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of at a
sewing-school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh you naughty girl!&rsquo; laughed Bell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The boys could rip it open with a knife in half the time
it took you to sew it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mean to keep them sewed
up all day; but I thought I&rsquo;d like Jack to remember me the
first thing this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girls,&rsquo; whispered Margery, excitedly,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t stand there mooning&mdash;or sunning&mdash;for
ever!&nbsp; I thought there was a gopher in this tent last
night.&nbsp; I heard something scratching, and I thought it was
the dog outside; but just look at these two holes almost under
Laura&rsquo;s pillow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s fill them up, cover them
over&mdash;anything!&rsquo; gasped Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Laura will
never sleep here another night if she sees them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody insured Laura against gophers,&rsquo; said
Polly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She must take the fortunes of war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wake her,&rsquo; said Margery.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t sleep well, and her face is
flushed.&nbsp; Come, or we shall be late for
breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they returned, fresh and rosy, from their bath, there was
a stir of life in all the tents.&nbsp; Pancho had come from the
stage-station with mail; an odour of breakfast issued from the
kitchen, where Hop Yet was humming a fragment of Chinese song,
that ran something like this,&mdash;not loud, but unearthly
enough, as Bell used to say, to spoil almost any
cooking:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Dicky was abroad, radiant in a new suit of clothes, and Elsie
pushed her golden head out between the curtains, and proclaimed
herself strong enough for a wrestling-match with any boy or man
about the camp.</p>
<p>But they found Laura sitting on the edge of her straw bed,
directly over the concealed gopher-holes, a mirror in her hand
and an expression of abject misery on her countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried the girls in one
breath.&nbsp; But they needed no answer, as she turned her face
towards the light, for it was plainly a case of
poison-oak&mdash;one eye almost closed, and the cheek scarlet and
swollen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where do you suppose you got it?&rsquo; asked Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s everywhere; so
I don&rsquo;t see how I ever hoped to escape it.&nbsp; Yet
I&rsquo;ve worn gloves every minute.&nbsp; I think I must have
touched it when I went up the mountain trail with Jack.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a perfect fright already, and I suppose it has only
begun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it very painful?&rsquo; asked Polly,
sympathetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, you do look so funny, I can
hardly help laughing, but I&rsquo;m as sorry as I can
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should expect you to laugh&mdash;you generally
do,&rsquo; retorted Laura.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not
painful yet; but I don&rsquo;t care about that&mdash;it&rsquo;s
looking so ridiculous.&nbsp; I wonder if Dr. Winship could send
me home.&nbsp; I wish now that I had gone with Scott, for I
can&rsquo;t be penned up in this tent a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t hurt you to go out,&rsquo; said
Bell, &lsquo;and you can lie in the sitting-room.&nbsp; Just
wait, and let mamma try and cure you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a famous
doctor.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Bell finished dressing hurriedly, and
went to her mother&rsquo;s tent, while Polly and Margery smoothed
the bed with a furtive kick of straw over the offending
gopher-holes, and hung a dark shawl so as to shield Laura&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>Aunt Truth entered speedily, with a family medical guide under
one arm, and a box of remedies under the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor has told me just what to do, and he will see
you after breakfast himself.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t look so very
bad a case, dear; don&rsquo;t run about in the sun for a day or
two, and we&rsquo;ll bring you out all right.&nbsp; The doctor
has had us all under treatment at some time or other, because of
that troublesome little plant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get up to breakfast,&rsquo;
moaned Laura.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just as you like.&nbsp; But it is Polly&rsquo;s
birthday, you know (many happy returns, my sweet Pollykins), and
there are great preparations going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Mrs. Winship.&nbsp; The boys
would make fun of my looks; and I shouldn&rsquo;t blame
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Appear as the Veiled Lady,&rsquo; suggested Margery, as
Mrs. Winship went out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t come, and that&rsquo;s the end of
it,&rsquo; said Laura.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps if I bathe my face
all the morning I can come to dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast was cleared away, Hop Yet and Mrs.
Howard&rsquo;s little China boy Gin were given a half-holiday,
and allowed to go to a&mdash;neighbouring ranch to see a
&lsquo;flend&rsquo; of Hop Yet&rsquo;s; for it was a part of the
birthday scheme that Bell and Geoffrey should cook the festival
dinner.</p>
<p>Jack was so delighted at the failure of Polly&rsquo;s scheme
to sew him in his tent, that he simply radiated amiability, and
spent the whole morning helping Elsie and Margery with a set of
elaborate dinner-cards, executed on half-sheets of
note-paper.</p>
<p>The dinner itself was a grand success.&nbsp; Half of the cards
bore a caricature of Polly in the shape of a parrot, with the
inscription &lsquo;Polly want a cracker?&rsquo;&nbsp; The rest
were adorned with pretty sketches of her in her camping-dress, a
kettle in one hand, and underneath,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Polly, put the kettle on,<br />
We&rsquo;ll all have tea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bell and Geoff took turns at &lsquo;dishing up&rsquo; in the
kitchen, and sat down at the table between whiles; and they
barely escaped being mobbed when they omitted one or two dishes
on the programme, and confessed that they had been put on
principally for the &lsquo;style&rsquo; of the thing,&mdash;a
very poor excuse to a company of people who have made up their
mouths for all the delicacies of the season.</p>
<p>Jack was head waiter, and having donned a clean white blouse
of Hop Yet&rsquo;s and his best cap with the red button, from
which dangled a hastily improvised queue of black worsted, he
proceeded to convulse everybody with his Mongolian antics.&nbsp;
These consisted of most informal remarks in clever pigeon
English, and snatches of Chinese melody, rendered from time to
time as he carried dishes into the kitchen.&nbsp; Elsie laughed
until she cried, and Laura sat in the shadiest corner, her head
artistically swathed in white tarlatan.</p>
<p>Polly occupied the seat of honour at the end of the table
opposite Dr. Winship, and was happier than a queen.&nbsp; She
wore her new green cambric, with a bunch of leaves at her
belt.&nbsp; She was sun-burned, but the freckles seemed to have
disappeared mysteriously from her nose, and almost any one would
have admired the rosy skin, the dancing eyes, and the graceful
little auburn head, &lsquo;sunning over with curls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the last bit of dessert had been disposed of, and Dicky
had gone to sleep in his mother&rsquo;s lap, like an infant
boa-constrictor after a hearty meal, the presentation of gifts
and reading of poems took place; and Polly had to be on the alert
to answer all the nonsensical jokes that were aimed at her.</p>
<p>Finally, Bell crowned the occasion by producing a song of Miss
Mulock&rsquo;s, which had come in the morning mail from some girl
friend of Polly&rsquo;s in the East, who had discovered that
Polly&rsquo;s name had appeared in poetry and song without her
knowledge, and who thought she might be interested to hear the
composition.&nbsp; With the aid of Bell&rsquo;s guitar and
Jack&rsquo;s banjo the girls and boys soon caught the pretty air,
and sung it in chorus.</p>

<p>At the end, Dr. Winship raised his glass of lemonade, and
proposed to drink Miss Oliver&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; This was done
with enthusiasm, and Geoffrey immediately cried, &lsquo;Speech,
speech!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Polly, blushing
furiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speech!&rsquo; sung Jack and Philip vociferously,
pounding on the table with knife-handles to increase the
furore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speech!&rsquo; demanded the genial doctor, going over
to the majority, and smiling encouragingly at Polly, who was
pushed to her feet before she knew very well what she was
doing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, if Laura were not looking at me,&rsquo;
she thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d just like to speak right out, and
tell them a little bit of what is in my heart.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you are all in fun,&rsquo; she said, looking
bravely into the good doctor&rsquo;s eyes, &lsquo;and of course
no one could make a proper speech with Jack grinning like a
Cheshire cat, but I can&rsquo;t help telling you that this is the
happiest summer and the happiest birthday of my whole life, and
that I scarcely remember nowadays that I have no father and no
brothers and sisters, for I have never been alone or unhappy
since you took me in among you and Bell chose me for her friend;
and I think that if you knew how grateful I am for my beautiful
summer, dear Dr. Paul and Aunt Truth, you would be glad that you
gave it to me, and I love you all, dearly, dearly,
dearly!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the impulsive little creature
finished her maiden speech by dashing round the table and giving
Mrs. Winship one of her &lsquo;bear hugs,&rsquo; at which
everybody laughed and rose from the table.</p>
<p>Laura Burton, who was thoroughly out of conceit with the
world, and who was never quite happy when other people seemed for
the moment to be preferred to herself, thought this burst of
affection decidedly theatrical, but she did not know of any one
to whom she could confine her opinions just then; indeed, she
felt too depressed and out of sorts to join in the general
hilarity.</p>
<p>Dinner being over, Dr. Paul and the boys took the children and
sauntered up the ca&ntilde;on for a lazy afternoon with their
books.&nbsp; Elsie went to sleep in the new hammock that the
doctor had hung in the sycamores back of the girls&rsquo;
sleeping-tent, and Mrs. Winship lay down for her afternoon
nap.&nbsp; Pancho saddled the horses for Bell and Margery, who
went for a gallop.&nbsp; Polly climbed into the sky-parlour to
write a long letter to her mother, and Laura was left to solitude
in the sleeping-tent.&nbsp; Now everybody knows that a tent at
midday is not a particularly pleasant spot, and after many a
groan at the glare of the sun, which could not be tempered by any
system of shawls, and moans at the gopher-holes which she
discovered while searching for her ear-ring, and repeated
consultations with the hand-glass at brief intervals, during
which she convinced herself that she looked worse every
minute,&mdash;she finally discovered a series of alarming new
spots on her neck and chin.&nbsp; She felt then that camping out
was a complete failure, and that she would be taken home
forthwith if it could be managed, since she saw nothing before
her but day after day of close confinement and unattractive
personal appearance.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just my luck!&rsquo;
she grumbled, as she twisted up her hair and made herself as
presentable as possible under the trying circumstances.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever had a becoming or an
interesting illness.&nbsp; The chicken-pox, mumps, and sties on
my eyes&mdash;that&rsquo;s the sort of thing I have!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel much worse, Mrs. Winship,&rsquo; she said, going
into the sitting-room tent and waking Aunt Truth from a peaceful
snooze.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you can spare Pancho over night, I really
think I must trouble you to send Anne and me home at once.&nbsp;
I feel as if I wanted to go to bed in a dark room, and I shall
only be a bother if I stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my child, I&rsquo;m sorry to have you go off with
your visit unfinished.&nbsp; You know we don&rsquo;t mind any
amount of trouble, if we can make you comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very kind, but indeed I&rsquo;d rather
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly dare let you start in the hot
sun&mdash;without consulting the doctor, and everybody is away
except Polly; they will feel badly not to say
good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is nearly three o&rsquo;clock now, so the worst of
the sun is over, and we shall be at the ranch by eight this
evening.&nbsp; I feel too ill to say good-bye, any way, and we
shall meet Bell and Margery somewhere on the road, for they were
going to the milk ranch.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, my dear, if you&rsquo;ve made up your mind I
must yield,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Winship, getting up and smoothing
her hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t dare wake Elsie, she has had
such an exciting day; but I&rsquo;ll call Polly to help you pack,
and then tell Pancho to find Anne and harness the team.&nbsp;
While he is doing that, I&rsquo;ll get you a little lunch to take
with you and write a note to your mother.&nbsp; Perhaps you can
come again before we break camp, but I&rsquo;m sorry to send you
home in such a sad plight.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">POLLY&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY: SECOND
HALF</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">IN WHICH SHE WISHES SEE HAD NEVER BEEN
BORN.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;From Hebrew wit the maxim sprung,<br />
Though feet should slip, ne&rsquo;er let the tongue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> came at once to the tent,
where she found Laura getting her belongings together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Laura, it seems too bad you should go off so
suddenly.&nbsp; What can I do to help you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The very spirit of evil entered Laura&rsquo;s heart as she
looked at Polly, so fresh and pretty and radiant, with her
dimples dancing in and out, her hair ruffled with the effort of
literary composition, and the glow of the day&rsquo;s happiness
still shining in her eyes.&nbsp; She felt as if Polly was
&lsquo;glad inside&rsquo; that she was poisoned; she felt sure
she was internally jumping for joy at her departure; and, above
all, she felt that Polly was entirely too conceited over the
attention she had received that day, and needed to be
&lsquo;taken down a peg or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Red-haired, stuck-up, saucy thing,&rsquo; she thought,
&lsquo;how I should like to give her a piece of my mind before I
leave this place, if I only dared!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help, thank you,&rsquo; she said
aloud, in her iciest manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it will only make your head ache to bend over and
tug away at that valise, and I&rsquo;ll be only too glad to do
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of that,&rsquo; responded Laura,
meaningly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is useless for you to make any show of
regret over my going, for I know perfectly well that you are glad
to get me out of the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Laura, what do you mean?&rsquo; exclaimed Polly,
completely dazed at this bombshell of candour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean what I say; and I should have said it before if
I could ever have found a chance.&nbsp; Because I didn&rsquo;t
mention it at the time, you needn&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ve
forgotten your getting me into trouble with Mrs. Winship, the day
before the Howards came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was not my fault,&rsquo; said Polly, hotly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak any louder than the other girls, and
I didn&rsquo;t know Aunt Truth objected to Mrs. Pinkerton, and I
didn&rsquo;t know she was anywhere near.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You roared like the bull of Bashan&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what you did.&nbsp; Perhaps you can&rsquo;t help your voice, but
anybody in the ca&ntilde;on could have heard you; and Mrs.
Winship hasn&rsquo;t been the same to me since, and the boys
don&rsquo;t take the slightest notice of me lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are entirely mistaken, Laura.&nbsp; Dr. and Mrs.
Winship are just as lovely and cordial to you as they are to
everybody else, and the boys do not feel well enough acquainted
with you to &ldquo;frolic&rdquo; with you as they do with
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t so, but you are not sensitive enough to
see it; and I should never have been poisoned if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, go on, do!&rsquo; said Polly, beginning to lose her
self-control, which was never very great.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know I was a Lucrezia Borgia in disguise.&nbsp; How
did I poison you, pray?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you poisoned me; but you made me so
uncomfortable that day, bringing down Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s
lecture on my head and getting my best friend abused, that I was
glad to get away from the camp, and went out with Jack for that
reason when I was too tired and warm; and you are always trying
to cut me out with Bell and the boys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a perfectly&mdash;jet
black&mdash;fib!&rsquo; cried Polly, who was now thoroughly
angry; &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t think it is very polite of you to
attack the whole party, and say they haven&rsquo;t been nice to
you, when they&rsquo;ve done everything in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t your party any more than mine, is
it?&nbsp; And if I don&rsquo;t know how to be polite, I certainly
shan&rsquo;t ask <i>you</i> for instruction; for I must know as
much about the manners of good society as you do, inasmuch as I
have certainly seen more of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly sank into a camp-chair, too stunned for a moment to
reply, while Laura, who had gone quite beyond the point where she
knew or cared what she said, went on with a rush of words:
&lsquo;I mean to tell you, now that I am started, that anybody
who isn&rsquo;t blind can see why you toady to the Winships, who
have money and social position, and why you are so anxious to
keep everybody else from getting into their good graces; but they
are so partial to you that they have given you an entirely false
idea of yourself; and you might as well know that unless you keep
yourself a little more in the background, and grow a little less
bold and affected and independent, other people will not be quite
as ready as the Winships to make a pet of a girl whose mother
keeps a boarding-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Laura!&nbsp; It was no sooner said than she regretted
it&mdash;a little, not much.&nbsp; But poor Polly!&nbsp; Where
was her good angel then?&nbsp; Why could she not have treated
this thrust with the silence and contempt it deserved?&nbsp; But
how could Laura have detected and probed the most sensitive spot
in the girl&rsquo;s nature?&nbsp; She lost all command of
herself.&nbsp; Her rage absolutely frightened her, for it made
her deaf and blind to all considerations of propriety and
self-respect, and for a moment she was only conscious of the wild
desire to strike&mdash;yes, even to kill&mdash;the person who had
so insulted all that was dearest to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to say another word!&rsquo; she
panted, with such flaming cheeks and such flashing eyes that
Laura involuntarily retreated towards the door, half afraid of
the tempest her words had evoked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dare
to say another word, or I don&rsquo;t know what I may do!&nbsp;
Yes, I am glad you are going, and everybody will be glad, and the
sooner you go the better!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made everybody
miserable ever since you came, with your jealousy and your gossip
and your fine-lady airs; and if Aunt Truth hadn&rsquo;t loved
your mother, and if we were mean enough to tell tales, we would
have repeated some of your disagreeable speeches long ago.&nbsp;
How can you dare to say I love the Winships for anything but
themselves?&nbsp; And if you had ever seen my darling mother, you
never could have called her a boarding-house keeper, you
cruel&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, but the dashing torrent of angry words stopped at the mere
mention of her mother.&nbsp; The word recalled her to herself,
but too late.&nbsp; It woke in her memory the clasp of her
mother&rsquo;s arms, the sound of the sweet, tired voice:
&lsquo;Only two of us against the big world, Polly&mdash;you and
I.&nbsp; Be brave, little daughter, brave and
patient.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, how impatient and cowardly she had
been!&nbsp; Would she never learn to be good?&nbsp; The better
impulses rushed back into her heart, and crowded out the bad ones
so quickly that in another moment she would have flung herself at
Laura&rsquo;s feet, and implored her forgiveness merely to gain
again her own self-respect and her mother&rsquo;s approval; but
there was no time for repentance (there isn&rsquo;t sometimes),
for the clatter of wheels announced Pancho&rsquo;s approach with
the team, and Mrs. Winship and Anne Burton came into view,
walking rapidly towards the tent.</p>
<p>Laura was a good deal disconcerted at their ill-timed
appearance, but reflected rapidly that if Mrs. Winship had
overheard anything, it was probably Polly&rsquo;s last speech, in
which case that young person would seem to be more in fault than
herself, so stepping out of the tent she met Mrs. Winship and
kissed her good-bye.</p>
<p>Little Anne ran on and jumped into the wagon, with all a
child&rsquo;s joy at the prospect of going anywhere.&nbsp;
Polly&rsquo;s back was turned, but she could not disappear
entirely within the tent without causing Mrs. Winship surprise;
and she went through a lifetime of misery and self-reproach in
that minute of shame and fear, when she dared neither to advance
nor retreat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like to let you go alone, Laura,
without consulting the doctor, and I can&rsquo;t find him,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Winship.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you are nervous and
trembling!&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t you better wait until
to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you, Mrs. Winship.&nbsp; I am all ready now,
and would prefer to go.&nbsp; I think perhaps I have stayed quite
long enough, as Polly has just told me that everybody is glad to
see the last of me, and that I&rsquo;ve made you all miserable
since I came.</p>
<p>This was the climax to Polly&rsquo;s misery; for she was
already so overcome by the thought of her rudeness that she was
on the point of begging Laura&rsquo;s pardon for that particular
speech then and there, and she had only to hear her exact words
repeated to feel how they would sound in Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s
ears.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winship was so entirely taken aback by Laura&rsquo;s
remark, that she could only ejaculate,
&lsquo;Polly&mdash;said&mdash;that!&nbsp; What do you
mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am quite ready to think she said more than she
intended, but those were her words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Polly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly turned.&nbsp; Alas! it was plain enough that this was no
false accusation.&nbsp; Her downcast eyes, flushed, tear-stained
cheeks, quivering lips, and the silent shame of her whole figure,
spoke too clearly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can it be possible, Polly, that you spoke in such a way
to a guest who was about to leave my house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The word was wrung from Polly&rsquo;s trembling lips.&nbsp;
What could she say but &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&mdash;it was
true,&mdash;and how could she repeat the taunts that had provoked
her to retort?&nbsp; They were not a sufficient excuse; and for
that matter, nothing could be a sufficient excuse for her
language.&nbsp; Now that she was confronted with her own fault,
Laura&rsquo;s seemed so small beside it that she would have been
ashamed to offer it as any justification.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winship grew pale, and for a moment was quite at a loss
as to the treatment of such a situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more about it, Mrs. Winship,&rsquo;
said Laura; &lsquo;we were both angry, or we should never have
forgotten ourselves, and I shall think no more of
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Laura spoke with such an air of modest virtue,
and seemed so ready to forgive and forget, that Polly in her
silence and confusion appeared worse than ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I want you to remember that you are my guest, not
Pauline&rsquo;s; that I asked you to come and ask you to
remain.&nbsp; I cannot allow you to go simply because you do not
chance to be a favourite with another of my guests.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Oh! the pang these words gave Polly&rsquo;s faulty, tender
little heart!)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only going because I feel so ill,&mdash;not a bit
because of what Polly said; I was in the wrong, too, perhaps, but
I promise not to let anybody nor anything make me quarrel when I
visit you again.&nbsp; Good-bye!&rsquo; and Laura stepped into
the wagon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust you will not mention this to your mother, since
I hope it is the only unpleasant incident of your visit; and it
is no fault of mine that you go away with an unhappy impression
of our hospitality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here Mrs. Winship reached up and
kissed little Anne, and as the horses were restive, and no one
seemed to have anything further to say, Pancho drove off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care to talk with you any more at
present, Polly,&rsquo; said Mrs. Winship.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am too
hurt and too indignant to speak of your conduct quietly.&nbsp; I
know the struggles you have with your temper, and I am quite
willing to sympathise with you even when you do not come off
victorious; but this is something quite different.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t conceive how any amount of provocation or dislike
could have led you into such disloyalty to me&rsquo;; and with
this she walked away.</p>
<p>Polly staggered into a little play-room tent of Dicky&rsquo;s,
where she knew that she could be alone, pinned the curtains
together so that no one could peep in, and threw herself down
upon the long cushioned seat where Dicky was wont to take his
afternoon nap.&nbsp; There, in grief and despair, she sobbed the
afternoon through, dreading to be disturbed and dreading to be
questioned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My beautiful birthday spoiled,&rsquo; she moaned,
&lsquo;and all my own fault!&nbsp; I was so happy this morning,
but now was ever anybody so miserable as I?&nbsp; And even if I
tell Aunt Truth what Laura said, she will think it no excuse, and
it isn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As it neared supper-time she made an opening in the back of
the tent, and after long watching caught sight of Gin on his way
to the brook for water, signalled him, and gave him this
despairing little note for Mrs. Winship:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt
Truth</span>,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t ask you to forgive me&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t deserve to be forgiven&mdash;but I ask you to do me
just one more of your dear little kindnesses.&nbsp; Let me stay
alone in Dicky&rsquo;s tent till morning, and please don&rsquo;t
let any one come near me.&nbsp; You can tell everybody the whole
story to-night, if you think best, though I should be glad if
only Dr. Paul and Bell need know; but I do not mind anything
after displeasing you&mdash;nothing can be so bad as that.&nbsp;
Perhaps you think I ought to come out and confess it to them
myself, as a punishment; but oh, Aunt Truth, I am punishing
myself in here alone worse than any one else can do it.&nbsp; I
will go back to Santa Barbara any time that you can send me to
the stage station, and I will never ask you to love me again
until I have learned how to control my temper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your wretched, wretched</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Polly</span>.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I remember that it is my birthday, and all
that you have done for me, to-day and all the other days.&nbsp;
It looks as if I were ungrateful, but in spite of what I did I am
not.&nbsp; The words just blazed out, and I never knew that they
were going to be said till I heard them falling from my
mouth.&nbsp; It seems to me that if I ever atone for this I will
have a slate and pencil hanging to my belt, and only write what I
have to say.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Polly</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moisture came to Mrs. Winship&rsquo;s eyes as she read
this tear-stained little note.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
something here I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rsquo; she
thought; &lsquo;and yet Polly confessed that Laura told the
truth.&nbsp; Poor child!&mdash;but she has got to learn patience
and self-control through suffering.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;ll
keep the matter a secret from everybody at present, and stand
between her and my inquisitive brood of youngsters,&rsquo; and
she slipped the note into her pocket.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock the members of the family came into camp
from various directions, and gathered about the
supper-table.&nbsp; All were surprised at Laura&rsquo;s sudden
departure, but no one seemed especially grief-stricken.&nbsp;
Dicky announced confidentially to Philip that Laura was a
&lsquo;norful &rsquo;fraid-cat of frogs,&rsquo; and Jack ventured
the opinion that Miss Laura hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;boy&rsquo; enough
in her for camp-life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where is Polly?&rsquo; asked Bell, looking round
the table, as she pinned up her riding-skirt and sat down in her
usual seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has a bad headache, and is lying down,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Winship, quietly; &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll be all right in the
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Headache!&rsquo; ejaculated four or five people at
once, dropping their napkins and looking at each other in
dismay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and rub her head with Cologne,&rsquo;
said Margery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go and sit with her,&rsquo; said Elsie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been teasing her, Jack?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Howard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too much birthday?&rsquo; asked Dr. Paul.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tell her we can spare almost anybody else
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless the child, she wants me if she is sick.&nbsp; Go
on with your suppers, I&rsquo;ll see to her,&rsquo; and Bell rose
from the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear, I want you all to leave her alone at
present,&rsquo; said Mrs. Winship, decidedly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve put her to bed in Dicky&rsquo;s play-tent, and
I want her to be quiet.&nbsp; Gin has taken her some supper, and
she needs rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly Oliver in need of rest!&nbsp; What an incomprehensible
statement!&nbsp; Nobody was satisfied, but there was nothing more
to be said, though Bell and Philip exchanged glances as much as
to say, &lsquo;Something is wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Supper ended, and they gathered round the camp-fire, but
nothing was quite as usual.&nbsp; It was all very well to crack
jokes, but where was a certain merry laugh that was wont to ring
out, at the smallest provocation, in such an infectious way that
everybody else followed suit?&nbsp; And who was there, when Polly
had the headache, to make a saucy speech and look down into the
fire innocently, while her dimples did everything that was
required in order to point the shaft?&nbsp; And pray what was the
use of singing when there was no alto to Bell&rsquo;s treble, or
of giving conundrums, since it was always Polly who thought of
nonsensical answers better than the real ones?&nbsp; And as for
Jack, why, it was folly to shoot arrows of wit into the air when
there was no target.&nbsp; He simply stretched himself out beside
Elsie, who was particularly quiet and snoozed peacefully, without
taking any part in the conversation, avowing his intention to
&lsquo;turn in&rsquo; early.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turn in&rsquo; early,
forsooth!&nbsp; What was the matter with the boy?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rsquo; said Bell, plaintively;
&lsquo;we can&rsquo;t be anything but happy, now that we have
Elsie here; but it needs only one small headache to show that
Polly fills a long-felt want in this camp.&nbsp; You think of her
as a modest spoke in the wheel till she disappears, and then you
find she was the hub.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Margery, &lsquo;I think every one
round this fire is simply angelic, unless I except Jack; but the
fact is that Polly is&mdash;well, she is&mdash;Polly, and I dare
any one to contradict me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The judgment of the court is confirmed,&rsquo; said
Philip.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And the shark said, &ldquo;If you<br />
Don&rsquo;t believe it is true,<br />
Just look at my wisdom tooth!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sang Geoffrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if any one ever tells me again that she has red
hair and hasn&rsquo;t good features, I should just like to show
them a picture of her as she was to-day at the
dinner-table!&rsquo; exclaimed Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if anybody needed features with those
dimples,&rsquo; added Elsie, &lsquo;or would mind red hair when
it was such pretty hair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think a report of this conversation would go far
towards curing Polly,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship, with a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you say we can&rsquo;t go in there before we go to
bed, <i>mamacita</i>?&rsquo; whispered Bell in her mother&rsquo;s
ear, as the boys said good-night&mdash;and went towards their
tent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; she answered decidedly, with a fond
kiss for each of the girls, &lsquo;Polly herself asked me to keep
everybody away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Polly herself wanted to be alone!&nbsp; Would wonders never
cease?</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dicky, who had disappeared for a moment, came back
to the fire, his bosom heaving with grief and rage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to my play-tent,&rsquo; he sobbed, &lsquo;and
putted my hand underneath the curtain and gave Polly a piece of
my supper cake I saved for her&mdash;not the frosted part, but
the burnt part I couldn&rsquo;t eat&mdash;and she liked it and
kissed my hand&mdash;and then I fought she was lonesome, and
would like to see my littlest frog, and I told her to put out her
hand again for a s&rsquo;prise, and I squeezed him into it tight,
so &rsquo;t he wouldn&rsquo;t jump&mdash;and she fought it was
more cake, and when she found it wasn&rsquo;t she frew my
littlest frog clear away, and it got losted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This brought a howl of mirth from everybody, and Dicky was
instructed, while being put to bed, not to squeeze little frogs
into people&rsquo;s hands in the dark, as it sometimes affected
them unpleasantly.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All this time Polly was lying in the tent, quite exhausted
with crying, and made more wretched by every sound of voices
wafted towards her.&nbsp; Presently Gin appeared with her
night-wrapper and various things for comfort sent her by the
girls; and as she wearily undressed herself and prepared for the
night, she found three little messages of comfort pinned on the
neck and sleeves of her flannel gown, written in such colossal
letters that she could easily read them by the moonlight.</p>
<p>On the right sleeve:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><b>Cheer up!&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will never desert Mr. Micawber!&rsquo;</b></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bell</span>.</p>

<p>On the left sleeve:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Darling

order to stay with you.&nbsp; Lovingly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Meg</span>.</p>

<p>On the neck:&mdash;</p>

couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The boys (great stupids!) think you have the headache.&nbsp;
We girls can all see that you are in trouble, but only the Fairy
Godmother <i>knows why</i>; and though she can&rsquo;t make a
beautiful gold coach out of this pumpkin, because there&rsquo;s
something wrong about the pumpkin, yet she will do her best for
Cinderella, and pull her out of the ashes somehow.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p>Polly&rsquo;s tears fell fast on the dear little notes, which
she kissed again and again, and tucked under her pillow to bring
her sleep.&nbsp; &lsquo;Elsie knows something,&rsquo; she
thought, &lsquo;but how? she knows that I&rsquo;m in trouble and
that I&rsquo;ve done wrong, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have said that
about not being able to turn a bad pumpkin into a beautiful gold
coach; but perhaps she can get Aunt Truth to forgive me and try
me again.&nbsp; Unless she can do it, it will never come to pass,
for I haven&rsquo;t the courage to ask her.&nbsp; I would rather
run away early in the morning and go home than have her look at
me again as she did to-day.&nbsp; Oh! what shall I do?&rsquo; and
Polly went down on her knees beside the rough couch, and sobbed
her heart out in a childish prayer for help and comfort.&nbsp; It
was just the prayer of a little child telling a sorrowful story;
because it is when we are alone and in trouble that the unknown
and mysterious God seems to us most like a Father, and we throw
ourselves into the arms of His love like helpless children, and
tell Him our secret thoughts and griefs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Father in heaven,&rsquo; she sobbed,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t forgive me if I ought not to be forgiven, but
please make Aunt Truth feel how sorry I am, and show me whether I
ought to tell what made me so angry, though it&rsquo;s no
excuse.&nbsp; Bless and keep my darling patient little mother,
and help me to grow more like her, and braver and stronger too,
so that I can take care of her soon, and she needn&rsquo;t work
hard any longer.&nbsp; Please forgive me for hating some things
in my life as much as I do, and I will try and like them better;
but I think&mdash;yes, I know&mdash;that I am full of wicked
pride; and oh, it seems as if I could never, never get over
wanting to live in a pretty house, and wear pretty dresses, and
have my mother live like Bell&rsquo;s and Margery&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
And oh, if Thou canst only forgive me for hating boarders so
dreadfully, and being ashamed of them every minute, I will try
and like them better and tell everybody that we take them&mdash;I
will indeed; and if I can only once make Aunt Truth love and
trust me again, I will make the boarders&rsquo; beds and dust
their rooms for ever without grumbling.&nbsp; Please, dear Father
in heaven, remember that I haven&rsquo;t any father to love me or
to teach me to be good; and though mamma does her best, please
help her to make something out of me if it can be done.&nbsp;
Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truth,&rsquo; said Mrs. Howard, when all was quiet
about the camp, &lsquo;Elsie wants to see you a moment before she
goes to sleep.&nbsp; Will you go to her tent, while I play a game
of cribbage with Dr. Paul?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked like a blossom in all the beautiful greenness of
her tent, with her yellow head coming out from above the greens
and browns of the cretonne bed-cover for all the world like a
daffodil pushing its way up through the mould towards the spring
sunshine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunt Truth,&rsquo; she said softly, as Mrs. Winship sat
down beside her, &lsquo;you remember that Dr. Paul hung my
hammock in a new place to-day, just behind the girls&rsquo;
sleeping-tent.&nbsp; Now I know that Polly is in trouble, and
that you are displeased with her.&nbsp; What I want to ask, if I
may, is, how much you know; for I overheard a great deal
myself&mdash;enough to feel that Polly deserves a
hearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I overheard nothing,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Winship.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All that I know Polly herself confessed in Laura&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Polly told Laura, just as she was going away,
that everybody would be glad to see the last of her, and that she
had made everybody miserable from the beginning of her
visit.&nbsp; It was quite inexcusable, you know, dear, for one of
my guests to waylay another, just as she was leaving, and make
such a cruel speech.&nbsp; I would rather anything else had
happened.&nbsp; I know how impetuous Polly is, and I can forgive
the child almost anything, her heart is so full of love and
generosity; but I cannot overlook such a breach of propriety as
that.&nbsp; Of course I have seen that Laura is not a favourite
with any of you.&nbsp; I confess she is not a very lovable
person, and I think she has led a very unwholesome life lately
and is sadly spoiled by it; still that is no excuse for
Polly&rsquo;s conduct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; sighed Elsie, with
a little quiver of the lip.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I could plead
a better case for Polly, but I see exactly how thoughtless and
impolite she was; yet, if you knew everything, auntie, dear, you
would feel a little different.&nbsp; Do you think it was nice of
Laura to repeat what Polly said right before her, and just as she
was going away, when she knew it would make you uncomfortable and
that you were not to blame for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, hardly.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t show much tact; but
girls of fifteen or sixteen are not always remarkable for social
tact.&nbsp; I excused her partly because she was half-sick and
nervous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; Elsie went on, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear
the whole quarrel, so that I do not know how long it lasted nor
who began it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help thinking it was Laura,
though, for she&rsquo;s been trying her best to provoke Polly for
the last fortnight, and until to-day she has never really
succeeded.&nbsp; I was half asleep, and heard at first only the
faint murmur of voices, but when I was fully awake, Laura was
telling Polly that she doted on you simply because you had money
and position, while she had not; that you were all so partial to
her that she had lost sight of her own deficiencies.&nbsp; Then
she called her bold and affected, and I don&rsquo;t know what
else, and finally wound up by saying that nobody but the Winships
would be likely to make a pet of the daughter of a boarding-house
keeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elsie!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Winship; &lsquo;this
grows worse and worse!&nbsp; Is it possible that Laura Burton
could be guilty of such a thought?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be mistaken.&nbsp; I was too excited not
to hear very clearly; and the moment the words were spoken I knew
my poor dear&rsquo;s fiery temper would never endure that.&nbsp;
And it didn&rsquo;t; it blazed out in a second, but it
didn&rsquo;t last long, for before I could get to the tent she
had stopped herself right in the middle of a sentence; and in
another minute I heard your voice, and crept back to the hammock,
thinking that everything would be settled by Laura&rsquo;s going
away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d no idea that she would pounce on Polly and
get her in disgrace, the very last thing, when she knew that she
was responsible for the whole matter.&nbsp; You see, auntie,
that, impolite as Polly was, she only told Laura that we girls
were glad she was going.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t bring you in,
after all; and Laura knew perfectly well that she was a welcome
visitor, and we all treated her with the greatest politeness,
though it&rsquo;s no use to say we liked her much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry for the whole affair,&rsquo; sighed
Mrs. Winship, &lsquo;there is so much wrong on both sides.&nbsp;
Laura&rsquo;s remark, it is true, would have angered almost
anybody who was not old and wise enough to see that it deserved
only contempt; but both the girls should have had too much
respect for themselves and for me to descend to such an
unladylike quarrel.&nbsp; However, I am only too glad to hear
anything which makes Polly&rsquo;s fault less, for I love her too
dearly not to suffer when I have to be severe with
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to overlook her
fault,&rsquo; continued Elsie, with tears in her eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know just how wretched and penitent she must
be&mdash;Polly is always so fierce against her own
faults&mdash;but what must be making her suffer most is the
thought that she has entirely lost your confidence and good
opinion.&nbsp; Oh, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that God feels
sorrier this very minute for Polly, who fights and fights against
her temper, like a dear sunbeam trying to shine again and again
when a cloud keeps covering it up, than He does for Laura, who
has everything made smooth for her, and who is unhappy when her
feathers are ruffled the least bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right, dear, in so far that a fiery little soul
like Polly&rsquo;s can, if it finds the right channels, do
God&rsquo;s work in the world better than a character like
Laura&rsquo;s, which is not courageous, nor strong, nor sweet
enough for great service, unless it grows into better things
through bitter or rich experiences.&nbsp; Now, good-night, my
blessed little peacemaker; sleep sweetly, for I am going into
Polly&rsquo;s tent to have a good talk with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Winship dropped the curtains of Elsie&rsquo;s tent
behind her, and made her way quietly through the trees, the
tinkling sound of a banjo fell upon the still night air; and
presently, as she neared Polly&rsquo;s retreat, this facetious
serenade, sung by Jack&rsquo;s well-known voice, was wafted to
her ears:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Prithee, Polly Oliver, why bide ye so
still?<br />
Pretty Polly Oliver, we fear you are ill.<br />
I&rsquo;m singing &rsquo;neath thy window, when night dews are
chill,<br />
For, pretty Polly Oliver, we hear you are ill.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was about to despatch Master Jack to his tent with a round
scolding, when the last words of the song were frozen on his lips
by the sound of a smothered sob, in place of the saucy retort he
hoped to provoke.&nbsp; The unexpected sob frightened him more
than any fusilade of hot words, and he stole away in the darkness
more crestfallen than he had been for many a year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winship, more troubled than ever, pulled apart the canvas
curtains, and stood in the opening, silently.&nbsp; The sight of
the forlorn little figure, huddled together on the straw bed,
touched her heart, and, when Polly started up with an eloquent
cry and flew into her extended arms, she granted willing
forgiveness, and the history of the afternoon was sobbed out upon
her motherly shoulder.</p>
<p>The next morning Mrs. Winship announced that Polly was better,
sent breakfast to her tent, and by skilful generalship drove
everybody away from the camp but Elsie, who brought Polly to the
sitting-room, made her comfortable on the lounge, and,
administering much good advice to Margery and Bell concerning
topics to be avoided, admitted them one by one into her presence,
so that she gradually regained her self-control.&nbsp; And at the
dinner-table a very pale Polly was present again, with such a
white face and heavy eyes that no one could doubt there had been
a headache, while two people, at least, knew that there had been
a heartache as well.&nbsp; The next day&rsquo;s mail carried the
following letter to Laura Burton:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Camp
Chaparral</span>, <i>August</i> 16, 188&mdash;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Laura</span>,&mdash;As I told you
when you were leaving, I cannot well say how sorry I am that
anything should have occurred to mar your pleasant remembrance of
your stay with us.&nbsp; That your dear mother&rsquo;s daughter
should have been treated with discourtesy while she was my guest
was very disagreeable to me; but I have learned that you were
yourself somewhat to blame in the affair, and therefore you
should have borne the harsh treatment you received with
considerable patience, and perhaps have kept it quite to
yourself.&nbsp; (&lsquo;That little cat told her, after
all,&rsquo; said Laura, when she read this.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t think she was that kind.&rsquo;)&nbsp; Polly would
never have confessed the cause of the quarrel, because she knew
nothing could justify her language; but Elsie was lying in the
hammock behind the tent and overheard the remark which so roused
Polly&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp; You were not aware, of course, how
sore a spot you touched upon, or you could never have spoken as
you did, though I well know that you were both too angry to
reflect.&nbsp; Polly is a peculiarly proud and high-spirited
girl&mdash;proud, I confess, to a fault; but she comes, on her
mother&rsquo;s side, from a long line of people who have had much
to be proud of in the way of unblemished honesty, nobility, fine
attainments, and splendid achievements.&nbsp; Of her
father&rsquo;s honourable services to his country, and his sad
and untimely death, you may have heard; but you may not know that
Mrs. Oliver&rsquo;s misfortunes have been very many and very
bitter, and that the only possibility of supporting and educating
Polly lies at present in her taking boarders, for her health will
not admit just now of her living anywhere save in Southern
California.&nbsp; I fail to see why this is not thoroughly
praiseworthy and respectable; but if you do not consider it quite
an elegant occupation, I can only say that Mrs. Oliver presides
over the table at which her &lsquo;boarders&rsquo; sit with a
high-bred dignity and grace of manner that the highest lady in
the land might imitate; and that, when health and circumstances
permit her to diminish the distance between herself and the great
world, she and her daughter Polly, by reason of their birth and
their culture, will find doors swinging wide to admit them where
you and I would find it difficult to enter.&nbsp; Polly
apologises sincerely for her rudeness, and will write you to that
effect, as of course she does not know of this letter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Sincerely your friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Truth

<span class="GutSmall">ROUND THE CAMP-FIRE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The time before the fire they sat,<br />
And shortened the delay by pleasing chat.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> August days had slipped away
one after another, and September was at hand.&nbsp; There was no
perceptible change of weather to mark the advent of the new
month.&nbsp; The hills were a little browner, the dust a little
deeper, the fleas a little nimbler, and the water in the brook a
trifle lower, but otherwise Dame Nature did not concern herself
with the change of seasons, inasmuch as she had no old dresses to
get rid of, and no new ones to put on for a long time yet;
indeed, she is never very fashionable in this locality, and wears
very much the same garments throughout the year.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Elsie seemed almost as strong as any of the other girls now,
and could enter with zest into all their amusements.&nbsp; The
appetite of a young bear, the sound, dreamless sleep of a baby,
and the constant breathing in of the pure, life-giving air had
made her a new creature.&nbsp; Mrs. Howard and Jack felt, day by
day, that a burden of dread was being lifted from their hearts;
and Mrs. Howard especially felt that she loved every rock and
tree in the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>It was a charming morning, and Polly was seated at the
dining-room table, deep in the preparation of a lesson in reading
and pronunciation for Hop Yet.&nbsp; Her forehead was creased
with many wrinkles of thought, and she bit the end of her
lead-pencil as if she were engaged in solving some difficult
problem; but, if that were so, why did the dimples chase each
other in and out of her cheeks in such a suspicious
fashion?&nbsp; She was a very gentle, a very sedate Polly, these
latter days, and not only astonished her friends, but surprised
herself, by her good behaviour, her elegant reserve of manner,
her patience with Jack, and her abject devotion to Dicky.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t last,&rsquo; she sighed
to herself occasionally.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m almost too
good.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s always the way with me&mdash;I must
either be so bad that everybody is discouraged, or else so good
that I frighten them.&nbsp; Now I catch Bell and Elsie exchanging
glances every day, as much as to say, &ldquo;Poor Polly, she will
never hold out at this rate; do you notice that nothing ruffles
her&mdash;that she is simply angelic?&rdquo;&nbsp; As if I
couldn&rsquo;t be angelic for a fortnight!&nbsp; Why I have often
done it for four weeks at a stretch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery was in the habit of giving Hop Yet an English lesson
every other day, as he had been very loath to leave his evening
school in Santa Barbara and bury himself in a ca&ntilde;on, away
from all educational influences; but she had deserted her post
for once and gone to ride with Elsie, so that Polly had taken her
place and was evolving an exercise that Hop Yet would remember to
the latest day of his life.&nbsp; It looked simple
enough:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; The grass is dry.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; The fruit is ripe.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3: The chaparral is green.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; The new road is all right.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; The bay-&lsquo;rum&rsquo; tree is
fresh and pretty.</p>
<p>But as no Chinaman can pronounce the letter &lsquo;r,&rsquo;
it was laboriously rendered thus, when the unhappy time of the
lesson came:</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; The-glass-is-dly.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; The-fluit-is-lipe.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; The-chap-lal-is-gleen.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; The-new-load-is-all-light-ee.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; The
bay-lum-tlee-is-flesh-and-plitty.</p>
<p>Finally, when she attempted to introduce the sentence,
&lsquo;Around the rough and rugged rock the ragged rascal
ran,&rsquo; Hop Yet rose hurriedly, remarking, &lsquo;All
lightee; I go no more school jus&rsquo; now.&nbsp; I lun get
lunchee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bell came running down the path just then, and linking her arm
in Polly&rsquo;s said, &lsquo;Papa has the nicest plan.&nbsp; You
know the boys are so disappointed that Colonel Jackson
didn&rsquo;t ask them over to that <i>rodeo</i> at his cattle
ranch&mdash;though a summer <i>rodeo</i> is only to sort out fat
cattle to sell, and it is not very exciting; but papa promised to
tell them all about the old-fashioned kind some night, and he has
just remembered that to-morrow is Admission Day, September 9, so
he proposes a real celebration round the camp-fire to amuse
Elsie.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t know anything about California
even as it is now, and none of us know what it was in the old
days.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it will be fun?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly splendid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And papa wants us each to contribute
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A picnic!&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m coming to.&nbsp; I
have such a bright idea.&nbsp; He said that we might look in any
of his books, but Geoff and Jack are at them already, and
I&rsquo;d like a surprise.&nbsp; Now Juan Capistrano, an old
vaquero of Colonel Jackson&rsquo;s, is over here.&nbsp; He is a
wonderful rider; papa says that he could ride on a comet, if he
could get a chance to mount.&nbsp; It was he who told the boys
that the rodeo was over.&nbsp; Now I propose that we go and
interview Pancho and Juan, and get them to tell us some old
California stories.&nbsp; They are both as stupid as they can be,
but they must have had some adventures, I suppose, somewhere,
sometime.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll translate and write the things down,
for my part, and you and Margery can tell them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lovely!&nbsp; Oh, if we can only get an exciting
grizzly story, so that</p>
<blockquote><p>Every one&rsquo;s blood upon end it will stand,<br
/>
And the hair run cold in their veins!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And was Dr. Paul out here when California was admitted into
the Union&mdash;1850, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course; why, my child, he was one of the delegates
called by General Riley, the military governor, to meet in
convention at Monterey and make a State constitution.&nbsp; That
was September, too&mdash;the first day of September 1849.&nbsp;
He went back to the East some time afterwards, and stayed ten or
fifteen years; but he was a real pioneer and
&ldquo;forty-niner&rdquo; all the same.</p>
<p>The next night, September 9th, was so cool that the camp-fire
was more than ordinarily delightful; accordingly they piled on
more wood than usual, and prepared for a grand blaze.&nbsp; It
was always built directly in front of the sitting-room tent, so
that Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Winship could sit there if they liked;
but the young people preferred to lie lazily on their cushions
and saddles under the oak-tree, a little distance from the
blaze.&nbsp; The clear, red firelight danced and flickered, and
the sparks rose into the sombre darkness fantastically, while the
ruddy glow made the great oak an enchanted palace, into whose
hollow dome they never tired of gazing.&nbsp; When the light
streamed highest, the bronze green of the foliage was turned into
crimson, and, as it died now and then, the stars winked brightly
through the thousand tiny windows formed by the interlacing
branches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the doctor, bringing his Chinese
lounging-chair into the circle, and lighting his pipe so as to be
thoroughly happy and comfortable, &lsquo;will you banish
distinctions of age and allow me to sit among you this
evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; Margery said; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the
very point of the celebration.&nbsp; This is Admission Day, you
know, and why shouldn&rsquo;t we admit you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; and having put myself into a holiday humour by
dining off Pancho&rsquo;s dish of <i>guisado</i> (I suppose
to-night of all nights we must call beef and onion stew by its
local name), I will proceed to business, and we will talk about
California.&nbsp; By the way, I shall only conduct the exercises,
for I feel rather embarrassed by the fact that I&rsquo;ve never
killed, or been killed by, a bear, never been bitten by a
tarantula, poisoned by a rattlesnake, assaulted by a
stage-robber, nor anything of that sort.&nbsp; You have all read
my story of crossing the plains.&nbsp; I even did that in a
comparatively easy and unheroic fashion.&nbsp; I only wish, my
dear girls and boys, that we had with us some one of the brave
and energetic men and women who made that terrible journey at the
risk of their lives.&nbsp; The history of the California
Crusaders, the thirty thousand or more emigrants who crossed the
plains in &rsquo;48, more than equals the great military
expeditions of the Middle Ages, in magnitude, peril, and
adventure.&nbsp; Some went by way of Santa F&eacute; and along
the hills of the Gila; others, starting from Red River, traversed
the Great Stake Desert and went from El Paso del Norte to Sonora;
others went through Mexico, and, after spending over a hundred
days at sea, ran into San Diego and gave up their vessels; others
landed exhausted with their seven months&rsquo; passage round the
Horn; and some reached the spot on foot after walking the whole
length of the California peninsula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What privations they must have suffered!&rsquo; said
Mrs. Howard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never quite realised it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the amount of suffering that was endured in those
mountain passes and deserts can never be told in words.&nbsp;
Those who went by the Great Desert west of the Colorado found a
stretch of burning salt plains, of shifting hills of sand, with
bones of animals and men scattered along the trails; of terrible
and ghastly odours rising in the hot air from the bodies of
hundreds of mules, and human creatures too, that lay half-buried
in the glaring white sand.&nbsp; A terrible journey indeed; but
if any State in the Union could be fair enough, fertile enough,
and rich enough to repay such a lavish expenditure of energy and
suffering, California certainly was and is the one.&nbsp; Now who
can tell us something of the name &ldquo;California&rdquo;?&nbsp;
You, Geoffrey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Geoffrey has crammed!&rsquo; exclaimed Bell,
maliciously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe he&rsquo;s been reading up
all day and told papa what question to ask him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pass it on to you if you like,&rsquo;
laughed Geoffrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;you&rsquo;d never get another that you could
answer!&nbsp; Go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In 1534, one Hernando de Grijalva was sent by Hernando
Cortez to discover something or other, and it was probably he who
then saw the peninsula of California; but a quarter of a century
before this a romance called <i>Esplandian</i> had appeared in
Spain, narrating the adventures of an Amazonian queen who brought
allies from &ldquo;the right hand of the Indies&rdquo; to assist
the infidels in their attack upon Constantinople&mdash;by the way
I forgot to say that she was a pagan.&nbsp; This queen of the
Amazons was called Calafia, and her kingdom, rich in gold and
precious stones, was named California.&nbsp; The writer of the
romance derived this name, perhaps, from Calif, a successor of
Mohammed.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;Know that on the right hand of
the Indies there is an island named California, very close to the
Terrestial Paradise, and it was peopled by black women without
any man among them, for they lived in the fashion of the
Amazonia.&nbsp; They were of strong and hardy bodies, of ardent
courage, and of great force.&nbsp; Their island was the strongest
in all the world, with its steep cliffs and rocky shore.&nbsp;
Their arms were all of gold, and so was the harness of the wild
beasts which they tamed and rode.&nbsp; For in the whole island
there was no metal but gold.&nbsp; They lived in caves wrought
out of the rocks with much labour, and they had many ships with
which they sailed out to other countries to obtain
booty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cortez and Grijalva believed that they were
near the coast of Asia, for they had no conception of the size of
the world nor of the vastness of the Pacific Ocean; and as the
newly-discovered land corresponded with the country described in
the romance, they named the peninsula California.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My book,&rsquo; said Philip, &lsquo;declared that the
derivation of the name was very uncertain, and that it was first
bestowed on one of the coast bays by Bernal Diaz.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Philip!&rsquo; exclaimed Margery, &lsquo;do you
suppose we are going to believe that, after Geoff&rsquo;s lovely
story?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not; I only thought I&rsquo;d permit you to
hear both sides.&nbsp; I knew of course that you would believe
the prettier story of the two&mdash;girls always do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;pretty
story&rdquo;&mdash;your remark, I mean, so we won&rsquo;t believe
it; will we, girls?&rsquo; asked Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Polly, your eyes sparkle as if you couldn&rsquo;t
wait another minute; your turn next,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only afraid that I can&rsquo;t remember my
contribution, which is really Bell&rsquo;s and still more really
Pancho&rsquo;s, for he told it to us, and Bell translated it and
made it into a story.&nbsp; We call it &ldquo;Valerio; or, The
Mysterious Mountain Cave.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Begins well!&rsquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Jack, you must be nice.&nbsp; Remember this is
Bell&rsquo;s story, and she is letting me tell it so that I can
bear my share in the entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pancho believes every word of it,&rsquo; added Bell,
&lsquo;and says that his father told it to him; but as I had to
change it from bad Spanish into good English, I don&rsquo;t know
whether I&rsquo;ve caught the idea exactly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it will do quite nicely, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt,&rsquo; said Jack, encouragingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve
often heard you do good English into bad Spanish, and turn and
turn about is only fair play.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind me, Polly; I
will be gentle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack, if you don&rsquo;t behave yourself I&rsquo;ll
send you to bed,&rsquo; said Elsie; and he ducked his head
obediently into her lap, as Polly, with her hands clasping her
knees, and with the firelight dancing over her bright face,
leaned forward and told the Legend of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">VALERIO; OR, THE
MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAIN CAVE.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A long time ago, before the settlement of Santa Barbara
by the whites, the Mission <i>padres</i> had a great many Indians
under their control, who were known as <i>peons</i>, or
serfs.&nbsp; They were given enough to eat, were not molested by
the outside Indians, and were entirely peaceable.&nbsp; There
were so few mountain passes by which to enter Santa Barbara that
they were easily held, and of course the <i>padres</i> were
anxious to keep their Indians from running away, lest they should
show the wilder tribes the way to get in and commit
depredations.&nbsp; These peaceable Indians paid tribute to
intermediary tribes to hold the passes and do their
fighting.&nbsp; Those about the Mission gave corn and cereals and
hides and the products of the sea, and got in exchange
<i>pi&ntilde;ones</i> (pine nuts).&nbsp; One of these Indians,
named Valerio, was a strong, brave, handsome youth, whose haughty
spirit revolted at his servitude, and, after seeking an
opportunity for many weeks he finally escaped to the Santa Ynez
mountains, where he found a cave in which he hid himself, drawing
himself up by a rope and taking it in after him.&nbsp; The
Indians had unlimited belief in Valerio&rsquo;s mysterious and
wonderful powers.&nbsp; Pancho says that he could make himself
invisible at will, that locks and keys were powerless against
him; and that no one could hinder his taking money, horses, or
food.&nbsp; All sorts of things disappeared mysteriously by day
and by night, and the robberies were one and all laid to the door
of Valerio.&nbsp; But after a while Valerio grew lonely in his
mountain retreat.&nbsp; He longed for human companionship, and at
length, becoming desperate, he descended on the Mission
settlement and kidnapped a young Indian boy named Chito, took him
to his cave, and admitted him into his wild and lawless
life.&nbsp; But Chito was not contented.&nbsp; He liked home and
comfortable slavery better than the new, strange life; so he
seized the first opportunity, and being a bright, daring little
lad, and fleet of foot, he escaped and made his way to the
Mission.&nbsp; Arriving there he told wonderful stories of
Valerio and his life; how his marvellous white mare seemed to
fly, rather than gallop, and leaped from rock to rock like a
chamois; and how they lived upon wheat-bread, cheeses, wine, and
other delicacies instead of the coarse fare of the Indians.&nbsp;
He told them the location of the cave and described the way
thither; so the Alcalde (he was the mayor or judge, you know,
Elsie), got out the troops with their muskets, and the padres
gathered the Mission Indians with their bows and arrows, and they
all started in pursuit of the outlaw.&nbsp; Among the troops were
two <i>hechiceros</i> (wizards or medicine-men), whose bowed
shoulders and grizzled beards showed them to be men of many years
and much wisdom.&nbsp; When asked to give their advice, they
declared that Valerio could not be killed by any ordinary
weapons, but that special means must be used to be of any avail
against his supernatural powers.&nbsp; Accordingly, one of the
<i>hechiceros</i> broke off the head of his arrow, cast a charm
over it, and predicted that this would deal the fatal blow.&nbsp;
The party started out with Chito as a guide, and, after many
miles of wearisome travel up rugged mountain sides and over steep
and almost impassable mountain trails, they paused at the base of
a cliff, and saw, far up the height, the mouth of Valerio&rsquo;s
cave, and, what was more, Valerio himself sitting in the doorway
fast asleep.&nbsp; Alas! he had been drinking too heavily of his
stolen wine, or he would never have so exposed himself to the
enemy.&nbsp; They fired a volley at him.&nbsp; One shot only took
effect, and even this would not have been possible save that the
spell was not upon him because of his sleep; but the one shot
woke him and, half rising, he staggered and fell from the mouth
of the cave to a ledge of rocks beneath.&nbsp; He sprang to his
feet in a second and ran like a deer towards a tree where his
white mare was fastened.&nbsp; They fired another volley, but,
though the shots flew in every direction, Valerio passed on
unharmed; but just as he was disappearing from view the
<i>hechicero</i> raised his bow and the headless arrow whizzed
through space and pierced him through the heart.&nbsp; They
clambered up the cliffs with shouts of triumph and surrounded him
on every side, but poor Valerio had surrendered to a more
powerful enemy than they!&nbsp; Wonderful to relate, he still
breathed, though the wound should have been instantly
fatal.&nbsp; They lifted him from the ground and tied him on his
snow-white mare, his long hair reaching almost to the ground, his
handsome face as pale as death, the blood trickling from his
wound; but the mysterious power that he possessed seemed to keep
him alive in spite of his suffering.&nbsp; Finally one of the
hechiceros decided that the spell lay in the buckskin cord that
he wore about his throat&mdash;a rough sort of necklace hung with
bears&rsquo; claws and snake rattles&mdash;and that he never
would die until the magic cord was cut.&nbsp; This, after some
consultation, was done.&nbsp; Valerio drew his last breath as it
parted asunder, and they bore his dead body home in triumph to
the Mission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he is not forgotten.&nbsp; Stories are still told
of his wonderful deeds, and people still go in search of money
that he is supposed to have hidden in his cave.&nbsp; The Mexican
women who tell <i>suertes</i>, or fortunes, describe the location
of the money; but, as soon as any one reaches the cave, he is
warned away by a little old man who stands in the door and
protects the buried treasure.&nbsp; An Indian lad, who was riding
over the hills one day with his horse and his dogs, dismounted to
search for his moccasin, when he suddenly noticed that the dogs
had chased something into a cave in the rocks.&nbsp; He followed,
and, peering into the darkness, saw two gleaming eyes.&nbsp; He
thrust his knife between them, but struck the air; and, though he
had been standing directly in front of the opening, so that
nothing could have passed him, yet he heard the clatter of hoofs
and the tinkle of spurs, and, turning, saw a mysterious horseman,
whose pale face and streaming hair melted into the mountain mist,
as it floated down from the purple Santa Ynez peaks into the lap
of the vine-covered foot-hills below.&rsquo;</p>

&lsquo;Bravissima!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Splendid, Polly!&rsquo;
exclaimed the boys.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bell, you&rsquo;re a great
author!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done better myself&mdash;give you
my word!&rsquo; cried Jack, bowing profoundly to Bell and Polly
in turn, and presenting them with bouquets of faded leaves
hastily gathered from the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Polly covered herself with glory,&rsquo; said the
doctor; &lsquo;and I am very proud of your part in it, too, my
little daughter.&nbsp; I have some knowledge of Pancho&rsquo;s
capabilities as a narrator, and I think the &ldquo;Story of
Valerio&rdquo; owes a good deal to you.&nbsp; Now, who comes
next?&nbsp; Margery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, please,&rsquo; said Margery, &lsquo;for I have
another story.&nbsp; Take one of the boys, and let&rsquo;s have
more facts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, something historic and profound, out of the
encyclop&aelig;dia, from Jack,&rsquo; said Polly, saucily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, Miss Oliver.&nbsp; With you for an audience any
man might be inspired; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not a <i>boy</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, dear, remove that child from my sight, or I
shall certainly shake her!&nbsp; Phil, go on, just to keep Polly
quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; Being the oldest Californian present,
I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about Dr. Paul?&rsquo; asked the irrepressible
Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wasn&rsquo;t born here,&rsquo; responded Philip,
dryly, &lsquo;and I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s a quibble,&rsquo; interrupted
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa was here twenty years before you
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault that he came first,&rsquo;
answered Philip.&nbsp; &lsquo;Margery and I are not only the
oldest Californians present, but the only ones.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
that so, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite correct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you mean that way, I suppose you are; but still
papa helped frame the Constitution, and was here on the first
Admission Day, and was one of the Vigilantes&mdash;and I think
that makes him more of a real Californian than you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve just &ldquo;grown up with the
country.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my soul!&nbsp; What else could I do?&nbsp; I
would have been glad to frame the Constitution, admit the State,
and serve on the Vigilance Committee, if they had only waited for
me; but they went straight ahead with the business, and when I
was born there was nothing to do but stand round and criticise
what they had done, or, as you express it, &ldquo;grow up with
the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, as I was saying when I was
interrupted&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&nbsp; Uncle Doc has asked me to
tell Mrs. Howard and Elsie how they carried on the rodeos ten or
fifteen years ago.&nbsp; Of course I was only a little
chap&rsquo;&mdash;(&lsquo;<i>Very</i> little,&rsquo; murmured his
sister)&mdash;&lsquo;but never too small to stick on a horse, and
my father used often to take me along.&nbsp; The rodeos nowadays
are neither as great occasions, nor as exciting ones, as they
used to be; but this is the way a rodeo is managed.&nbsp; When
the spring rains are mostly over, and the grass is
fine,&mdash;say in April&mdash;the ranchero of a certain ranch
sends word to all his neighbours that he will hold a rodeo on a
certain day or days.&nbsp; Of course the cattle used to stray all
over the country, and get badly mixed, as there were no fences;
so the rodeo was held for the purpose of separating the cattle
and branding the calves that had never been marked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The owners of the various ranches assemble the night
before, bringing their vaqueros with them.&nbsp; They start out
very early in the morning, having had a cup of coffee, and ride
to the &ldquo;rodeo-ground,&rdquo; which is any flat, convenient
place where ca&ntilde;ons converge.&nbsp; Many of the cattle on
the hills round about know the place, having been there before,
and the vaqueros start after them and drive them to the
spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many vaqueros would there be?&rsquo; asked
Elsie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nine or ten, perhaps; and often from one thousand
to three thousand cattle&mdash;it depends on the number of
ranches and cattle represented.&nbsp; Some of the vaqueros form a
circle round the cattle that they have driven to the
rodeo-ground, and hold them there while others go back to the
ranch for breakfast and fresh horses.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Fresh horses so soon?&rsquo; said Mrs. Howard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought the mustangs were tough, hardy little beasts,
that would go all day without dropping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so they are; but you always have to begin to
&ldquo;part out&rdquo; the cattle with the freshest and
best-trained horses you have.&nbsp; The owners and their best
vaqueros now go into the immense band of cattle, and try to get
the cows and the unbranded calves separated from the rest.&nbsp;
You can imagine what skilful engineering this takes, even though
you never saw it.&nbsp; Two work together; they start a certain
cow and calf and work them through the band of cattle until they
near the outside, and then &ldquo;rush&rdquo; them to a place
three or four hundred yards beyond, where other vaqueros are
stationed to receive and hold them.&nbsp; Of course the cattle
don&rsquo;t want to leave the band, and of course they
don&rsquo;t want to stay in the spot to which they are
driven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t blame them!&rsquo; cried Bell
impetuously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Probably the cows remember the time
when they were branded themselves, and they don&rsquo;t want
their dear little bossies put through the same
operation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely.&nbsp; Then more cows and calves are
started in the same way; the greatest difficulty being had with
the first lot, for the cattle always stay more contentedly
together as the group grows larger.&nbsp; Occasionally one
&ldquo;breaks&rdquo; and runs off on the hills, and a vaquero
starts after him, throws the reata and lassos him, or
&ldquo;lass&rsquo;s&rdquo; him, as the California boys
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be frightful accidents,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Winship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but not so many as you would suppose, for the
horsemanship, in its particular way, is something
wonderful.&nbsp; When an ugly steer is lassoed and he feels the
reata or lariat round his neck, he sometimes turns and
&ldquo;makes&rdquo; for the horse, and unless the vaquero is
particularly skilful he will be gored and his horse too; but he
gives a dexterous turn to the lariat, the animal steps over it,
gets tangled and thrown.&nbsp; Frequently an animal breaks a horn
or a leg.&nbsp; Sometimes one fall is not enough; the steer jumps
up and pursues the horse.&nbsp; Then the vaquero keeps a little
ahead of him and leads him back to the rodeo-ground, where
another vaquero lassos him by the hind legs and throws him, while
the reata is taken off his neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is another danger, too,&rsquo; added Dr.
Winship.&nbsp; &lsquo;The vaquero winds the reata very tightly
round the pommel of his saddle to hold the steer, and he is
likely to have his finger caught in the hair-rope and cut
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I forgot that.&nbsp; Two or three of the famous
old vaqueros about Santa Barbara&mdash;Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a,
Jos&eacute; Antonio, and old Clemente&mdash;have each lost a
finger.&nbsp; Well, the vaqueros at length form in a circle round
the band of selected cattle.&nbsp; The ranch owner who gives the
rodeo takes his own cattle that he has found&mdash;the ones
bearing his brand, you know&mdash;and drives them in with the
ones to be branded, leaving in the rodeo-ground the cattle
bearing the brands of all the other rancheros.&nbsp; There has
been much drinking of <i>aguardiente</i> (brandy) and everybody
by this time is pretty reckless.&nbsp; Then they drive this
selected band to the home corral, the vaqueros yelling, the
cattle &ldquo;calling,&rdquo; and the reatas whizzing and
whistling through the air.&nbsp; If any unfortunate tries to
escape his fate he is pursued, &ldquo;lass&rsquo;d,&rdquo; and
brought back.&nbsp; By this time the cattle are pretty well
heated and angry, and when they get into the crowded corral they
horn each other and try to gore the horses.&nbsp; A fire is then
built in one corner of the corral and the branding-irons are
heated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! hold my hand, Polly, if the branding is going to
begin, I hate it so,&rsquo; exclaimed Elsie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t say much about it, but it&rsquo;s no
worse than a thousand things that people have to bear every year
of their lives.&nbsp; Animals never have to have teeth filled,
for instance, nor limbs amputated&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, just think of a calf with a wooden leg, or a cow
with false teeth!&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny?&rsquo;
laughed Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t have a thousand ills that human flesh
is heir to, so they must be thankful they get off so easy.&nbsp;
Well! the branding-irons are heated, as I say&mdash;each
cattle-owner having his special brand, which is properly
recorded, and which may be any device not previously used.&nbsp;
Two men now catch the calves; one lassoing them by the head, the
other by the legs.&nbsp; A third man takes the iron from the fire
and brands the chosen letter or hieroglyphic on the
animal&rsquo;s hind quarter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes on the fore quarter, don&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
asked Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen brands there,&mdash;your
horse has two, and our cow has one also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, a brand on the fore quarter shows that the animal
has been sold, but it always has the original brand on the hind
quarter.&nbsp; When a sale is effected, the new brand is put
anywhere in front of the fifth rib, and this constitutes what
they call a <i>venta</i>, or sale.&nbsp; If you notice some of
the little &ldquo;plugs&rdquo; ridden by Santa Barbara boys,
you&rsquo;ll see that they bear half a dozen brands.&nbsp; By the
way, if the rodeo has been a very large one, they are several
days branding the cattle, so they are turned out to
<i>pastorear</i> a little while each day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The brand was absolute sign of ownership, you know,
girls,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship; &lsquo;and though there was the
greatest care exercised in choosing and recording the brands,
there was plenty of opportunity for cheating.&nbsp; For instance,
a man would often see unbranded cattle when riding about, and
there was nothing to prevent his dismounting, building a fire,
heating his iron, and putting his own brand on them.&nbsp; Then,
at the next rodeo, they were simply turned over to him, for, as I
say, the brand was absolute ownership.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Whene&rsquo;er I take my rides abroad,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How many calves I see;<br />
And, as I brand them properly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They all belong to me,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I should like to see a rodeo!&rsquo; sighed
Elsie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how the vaqueros can
fling the reata while they are riding at full speed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t so very wonderful,&rsquo; said Polly,
nonchalantly &lsquo;the most ordinary people can learn it; why!
your brother Jack can lasso almost as well as a
Mexican.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I can &ldquo;lass&rdquo; any stationary object
myself,&rsquo; cried Bell; &lsquo;a hitching-post, or even a
door-knob; I can do it two or three times out of ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That shows immense skill,&rsquo; answered Jack,
&lsquo;but, as the thing you want to &ldquo;lass&rdquo; never
does stay still, and as it is absolutely necessary to catch it
more than three times out of ten, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t
make a name and fortune as a vaquero.&nbsp; Juan Capistrano, by
the way, used to be famous with the lariat.&nbsp; I had heard of
his adventure with a bull on the island of Santa Rosa, and I
asked him about it to-day; but he had so exhausted himself
telling stories to Bell that he had very few words for me.&nbsp;
You see there was a bull, on Santa Rosa island, so wild that they
wanted to kill him; but nobody could do it, though he was a
terror to any one who ventured on the island.&nbsp; They called
him &ldquo;Antiguelo,&rdquo; because of his long horns and long
tail.&nbsp; He was such a terrible fighter that all the vaqueros
were afraid to lass&rsquo; him, for he always broke away with the
lariat.&nbsp; You see a horse throws a bull by skill and not by
strength, of course.&nbsp; You can choke almost any bull; but
this one was too smart! he would crouch on his haunches and pull
back until the rope nearly choked him and then suddenly
&ldquo;make&rdquo; for the horse.&nbsp; Juan Capistrano had a
splendid horse&mdash;you see as much depends on the horse as the
man in such a case&mdash;and he came upon Antiguelo on the Cerro
Negro and lass&rsquo;d him.&nbsp; Well, did he fight? I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Si</i>, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, what happened?&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Yo lo mat&eacute;</i>&rdquo;
(I killed him), he said, with a shrug of his shoulders, and
that&rsquo;s all I could get out of Juan regarding his
adventure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t done your share, you lazy
boy,&rsquo; objected Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must tell us
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want to hear?&nbsp; I am up on all the
animal and vegetable life of Southern California, full of
interesting information concerning its old customs, can give you
Spanish names for all the things that come up in ordinary
conversation, and am the only man present who can make a raw-hide
reata,&rsquo; said Jack, modestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on and tell us how, O great and wise
<i>reatero</i>,&rsquo; said Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that myself,&rsquo; said Elsie,
&lsquo;for I&rsquo;ve seen him do it dozens of times, when he
should have been studying his little lessons.&nbsp; He takes a
big piece of raw hide, cuts a circle right out of the middle, and
then cuts round and round this until he has one long continuous
string, half an inch wide.&nbsp; He then stretches it and scrapes
the hair off with a knife or a piece of glass, gets it into four
strands, and braids it &ldquo;round.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you think braiding &ldquo;round&rdquo; is easy
to do,&rsquo; retorted Jack, in an injured tone; &lsquo;but I
know it took me six months to learn to do it well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fail to see,&rsquo; said his mother, &lsquo;how a
knowledge of &ldquo;braiding round&rdquo; and lassoing of wild
cattle is going to serve you in your university life and future
career.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, it will.&nbsp; I shall be the Buffalo Bill of
Harvard, and I shall give charming little entertainments in my
rooms, or in some little garden-plot suitable to the
purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you make a point of keeping up with your
class?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Winship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, unless they go too fast.&nbsp; My sports
won&rsquo;t take any more time than rowing or baseball.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll be a little more expensive, because I&rsquo;ll have
to keep some wild cattle constantly on hand, and perhaps a
vaquero or two; but a vaquero won&rsquo;t cost any more than a
valet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend furnishing you with a
valet,&rsquo; remarked his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I shall be self-supporting, mother dear.&nbsp; I
shall give exhibitions on the campus, and the gate-money will
keep me in luxury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is all very interesting,&rsquo; said Polly,
cuttingly; &lsquo;but what has it to do with California,
I&rsquo;d like to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor dear!&nbsp; Your brain is so weak.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you see that when I am the fashion in Cambridge, it
will be noised about that I gained my marvellous skill in
California?&nbsp; This will increase emigration.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t pretend to say it will swell the population like the
discovery of gold in &rsquo;48, but it will have a perceptible
effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are more modest than a whole mossy bank of
violets,&rsquo; laughed Dr. Paul.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Margery, will
you give us your legend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine is the story of Juan de Dios (literally, Juan of
God), and I&rsquo;m sorry to say that it has a horse in it, like
Polly&rsquo;s; only hers was a snow-white mare, and mine is a
coal-black charger.&nbsp; But they wouldn&rsquo;t tell us any
romantic love-stories; they were all about horses.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">STORY OF JUAN DE
DIOS.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In early days, when Americans were coming in to Santa
Barbara, there were many cattle-buyers among them; and there were
large bands of robbers all over the country who were ready to
pounce on these travellers on their way to the great cattle
ranchos, kill them, and steal their money and clothes, as well as
their horses and trappings.&nbsp; No one could understand how the
robbers got such accurate information of the movements of the
travellers, unless they had a spy somewhere near the Mission,
where they often stopped for rest and refreshment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, there was a certain young Indian vaquero in the
employ of the padres at La Mission de la Pur&iacute;sima.&nbsp;
He was a wonderful horseman, and greatly looked up to by his
brother vaqueros, because he was so strong, alert, and handsome,
and because he was always dressed elegantly in rich old Spanish
embroideries and velvets, given to him, he said, by men for whom
he had done great services.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day a certain traveller, a Spanish official of high
degree, came from Monterey to wed his sweetheart, the daughter of
the richest cattle-owner in all the country round.&nbsp; His
spurs and bit and bridle were of solid silver; his <i>jaquima</i>
(halter) was made of a hair rope whose strands had been dyed in
brilliant colours; his <i>tapaderos</i> (front of the stirrups),
<i>mochilas</i> (large leather saddle flaps), and
<i>sudaderos</i> (thin bits of leather to protect the legs from
sweat), were all beautifully stamped in the fashion used by the
Mexicans; his saddle blankets and his housings were all superb,
and he wore a broad sombrero encircled with a silver snake and
trimmed with silver lace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The traveller stayed at La Pur&iacute;sima all night,
and set out early in the morning to ride the last forty miles
that separated him from his bride.&nbsp; But Juan and two other
robbers were lying in wait for him behind a great rock that stood
at the entrance of a lonely ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; They appeared on
horseback, one behind the unfortunate man and two in front, so
that he could escape neither way.&nbsp; They finally succeeded in
lassoing the horse and throwing him to the ground with his rider,
who defended himself bravely with his knife, but was finally
killed and robbed, Juan taking his clothes and trappings, and the
other two dividing the contents of his purse.&nbsp; They could
not have buried their victim as successfully as usual, or else
they were surprised, and had to escape, for the body was found;
and Juan, whom the padres had begun to view with suspicion, was
nowhere to be found about the Mission.&nbsp; Troops were sent out
in pursuit of him, for this particular traveller was a high
official, and it was necessary that his death should be
avenged.&nbsp; They at last heard that Juan had been seen going
towards Santa Ynez Mission, and, pursuing him thither, they came
upon him as he was driving a band of horses into a corral, and
just in the act of catching his own horse, a noble and powerful
animal, called Azabache, because of his jet-black colour.&nbsp;
The men surrounded the corral, and ordered him to
surrender.&nbsp; He begged them to wait until he had saddled
Azabache, and then they might shoot them both down
together.&nbsp; He asked permission to call three times (<i>pegar
tres gritos</i>), and after the third call they were to
shoot.&nbsp; His last wish was granted.&nbsp; He saddled and
mounted his splendid horse, called
once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice,&mdash;but when the last shout
faded in the air, and the troops raised their muskets to fire,
behold, there was no Juan de Dios to be seen.&nbsp; They had been
surrounding the corral so that no one could have ridden out; they
looked among the horses, but Asabache was nowhere to be
found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just then a joyous shout was heard, so ringing and
triumphant that every man turned in the direction from which it
came.&nbsp; There, galloping up the hillside, nearly half a mile
distant, was Juan de Dios, mounted on his coal-black
Azabache!&nbsp; But it was no common sunshine that deepened the
gorgeous colours of his trappings and danced upon his silver
spurs till they glistened like two great stars!&nbsp; It was a
broad, glittering stream of light such as no mortal had ever seen
before and which almost blinded the eyes; and over this radiant
path of golden sunbeams galloped Juan de Dios, until he
disappeared over the crest of the mountain.&nbsp; Then the light
faded; the padres crossed themselves in silence and went home to
their Mission! and Juan de Dios never was heard of
more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modest little Margery was hailed with such cheers that you
could not have seen her cheeks for the blushes; and, just as the
party began to think of forsaking the fascinating camp-fire for
bed, Bell jumped up impetuously and cried, &lsquo;Here, Philip,
give me the castanets, please.&nbsp; Polly and Jack, you play
&ldquo;Las Palomas&rdquo; for me, and I&rsquo;ll sing and show
you the dance of that pretty Mexican girl whom I saw at the ball
given under the Big Grape Vine.&nbsp; Wait till I take off my
hair ribbon.&nbsp; Lend me your scarf, mamma.&nbsp; Now
begin!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It is barely possible, but not likely, that anything prettier
than Bell&rsquo;s Mexican <i>danza</i> was to be seen under the
light of the September stars that night; although they were
doubtless shining down upon a thousand lovely things.&nbsp; With
all the brightness of her loosened hair rising and falling with
the motion of her swaying figure&mdash;with her twinkling feet,
her crimson cheeks and parted lips, she looked the very spirit of
the dance, and her enraptured&mdash;audience only allowed her to
stop when she was absolutely breathless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh what a beautiful evening!&rsquo; exclaimed Elsie,
when the celebration was finally over.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was there
ever such a dear, dear ca&ntilde;on with such dear people in
it!&nbsp; If it only wouldn&rsquo;t rain and we could live here
for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Rain, rain, stay away!<br />
Come again another day,<br />
Little Elsie wants to play,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>recited Polly, and then everybody went to their straw
beds.</p>
<h2><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BREAKING CAMP</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The thirsty earth soaks up the rain,<br />
And drinks and gapes for drink again;<br />
The plants suck in the earth and are,<br />
With constant drinking, fresh and fair.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it did rain; and it
didn&rsquo;t wait until they were out of the ca&ntilde;on
either.&nbsp; It began long before the proper time, and it by no
means confined itself to a shower, but opened the winter season
fully a month before there was any need of it, and behaved
altogether in a most heartless and inconsiderate manner, like a
very spoil-sport of a rain.</p>
<p>It began after dark, so as to be just as disagreeable as
possible, and under the too slight cover of their tents the
campers could hear the rush and the roar of it like the tramping
of myriad feet on the leaves.&nbsp; Pancho and the two Chinamen
huddled under the broad sycamores in their rubber blankets, and
were dry and comfortable; but all the waterproof tents leaked,
save Elsie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But when it was dawn, the Sun, having heard nothing apparently
of any projected change in the weather, rose at the usual time in
the most resplendent fashion&mdash;brighter, rosier, and more
gloriously, if you will believe me, than he had risen that whole
long sunshiny summer!&nbsp; And he really must have felt paid for
getting up at such an unearthly hour in the morning, when, after
he had clambered over the grey mountain peaks, he looked down
upon Las Flores Ca&ntilde;on, bathed in the light of his own
golden beams.</p>
<p>If he knew anything about Ancient History and Biblical
Geography&mdash;and if he didn&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know who
should, inasmuch as he had been present from the beginning of
time&mdash;he must have thought it as fair as the Garden of Eden;
for Nature&rsquo;s face simply shone with cleanliness, like that
of a smiling child just fresh from its bath, and every leaf of
every tree glistened as he beamed upon it, and shook off its
crystal drops that he might turn them into diamonds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was only a shower,&rsquo; said Dr. Winship, as he
seated himself on a damp board and partook of a moist breakfast,
&lsquo;and with this sun the tents will be dry before night;
Elsie has caught no cold, the dust will be laid, and we can stay
another week with safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was hilarious over this decision save the
men-of-all-work, who longed unspeakably for a less poetic
existence&mdash;Hop Yet particularly, who thought camping out
&lsquo;not muchee good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dicky was more pleased than anybody, perhaps, as every day in
the ca&ntilde;on was one day less in school; not that he had ever
been to school, but he knew in advance, instinctively, that it
wouldn&rsquo;t suit him.&nbsp; Accordingly, he sought the wettest
possible places and played all day with superhuman energy.&nbsp;
He finally found Hop Yet&rsquo;s box of blueing under a tree, in
a very moist and attractive state of fluidity, and just before
dinner improved the last shining hour by painting himself a
brilliant hue and appearing at dinner in such a fiendish guise
that he frightened the family into fits.</p>
<p>Now Dr. Winship was one of the most weather-wise men in
California, and his predictions were always quite safe and
sensible; but somehow or other it did rain again in two or three
days, and it poured harder than ever, too.&nbsp; To be sure, it
cleared promptly, but the doctor was afraid to trust so fickle a
person as the Clerk of the Weather had become, and marching
orders were issued.</p>
<p>The boys tramped over all their favourite bits of country, and
the girls visited all their best beloved haunts, every one of
them dear from a thousand charming associations.&nbsp; They
looked for the last time in Mirror Pool, and saw the reflection
of their faces&mdash;rather grave faces just then, over the
leave-taking.</p>
<p>The water-mirror might have been glad to keep the picture for
ever on its surface&mdash;Margery with her sleek braids and
serene forehead; with Polly, saucy nose and mischievous eyes,
laughing at you like a merry water-sprite; Bell, with her
brilliant cheeks glowing like two roses just fallen in the brook;
and Gold Elsie, who, if you had put a frame of green leaves about
her delicate face and yellow locks, would have looked up at you
like a water-lily.</p>
<p>They wafted a farewell to Pico Negro, and having got rid of
the boys, privately embraced a certain Whispering Tree under
whose singing branches they had been wont to lie and listen to
all the murmuring that went on in the forest.</p>
<p>Then they clambered into the great thorough-brace wagon, where
they all sat in gloomy silence for ten minutes, while
Dicky&rsquo;s tan terrier was found for the fourth time that
morning; and the long train, with its baggage-carts, its
saddle-horses and its dogged little pack-mules, moved down the
rocky steeps that led to civilisation.&nbsp; The gate that shut
them in from the county road and the outer world was opened for
the last time, and shut with a clang, and it was all
over&mdash;their summer in a ca&ntilde;on!</p>

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
